# BioBERT-finetuned-FoodCancer

Fine-tuned BioBERT model for relation extraction task between @FOOD$ and @DISEASE$ entities. The text dataset acquired from the research abstracts which are obtained from PubMed search engine. We used the search term "food cancer". The entities are annotated manually by hand.

We have fine-tuned the other BERT-based model with this dataset, including BERT and DistilBERT. The model can be found at https://huggingface.co/Wiirin.

This project is one part of the master's thesis, BioBERT for Dietary Compounds and Cancer Relation Extraction, with Tampere University.
