The use of synthetic, natural, or biological agents to minimize the occurrence of @DISEASE$ in healthy individuals is defined as @DISEASE$ chemoprevention.	0
Chemopreventive agents inhibit the development of @DISEASE$ either by impeding DNA damage, which leads to malignancy or by reversing or blocking the division of premalignant cells with DNA damage.	0
The benefit of this approach has been demonstrated in clinical trials of @DISEASE$.	0
The continuous increase in @DISEASE$ cases, failure of conventional chemotherapies to control @DISEASE$, and excessive toxicity of chemotherapies clearly demand an alternative approach.	0
The first trial to show benefit of chemoprevention was undertaken in @DISEASE$ patients with the use of @FOOD$, which demonstrated a significant decrease in invasive @DISEASE$.	2
The success of using chemopreventive agents for protecting the high risk populations from @DISEASE$ indicates that the strategy is rational and promising.	0
Dietary components such as @FOOD$ have demonstrated inhibitory effects on @DISEASE$ cells indicating that they may serve as chemopreventive agents.	2
In this review, we have addressed the mechanism of chemopreventive and anticancer effects of several natural agents.	0
Of the numerous health benefits of @FOOD$, the anti@DISEASE$ effect is probably the most noticeable.	2
Observations over the past years have shown that the consumption of @FOOD$ in the diet provides strong protection against @DISEASE$ risk.	2
Previous studies involving @FOOD$ phytochemicals have usually focused on the @DISEASE$ chemopreventive properties, but there is little published evidence showing its therapeutic potential in @DISEASE$ treatment.	0
In view of the multitargeted carcinoma actions and lack of severe toxicity, some components of @FOOD$ are likely to play vital roles in the selective killing of @DISEASE$ cells.	2
However, the rational design of experimental studies and clinical trials are required to verify this concept.	0
This paper discusses the promises and pitfalls of @FOOD$ for the treatment of @DISEASE$.	0
Breast @DISEASE$ is the most common @DISEASE$ among females worldwide.	0
Several epidemiological studies suggested the inverse correlation between the intake of @FOOD$ and the incidence of @DISEASE$.	1
Substantial experimental studies indicated that many dietary natural products could affect the development and progression of @DISEASE$, such as @FOOD$	1
Their anti-@DISEASE$ effects involve various mechanisms of action, such as downregulating ER-α expression and activity, inhibiting proliferation, migration, metastasis and angiogenesis of @DISEASE$ cells, inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and sensitizing @DISEASE$ cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.	0
This review summarizes the potential role of dietary natural products and their major bioactive components in prevention and treatment of @DISEASE$, and special attention was paid to the mechanisms of action.	0
Epidemiological studies are providing strong evidence on beneficial health effects from dietary measures, leading scientists to actively investigate which foods and which specific agents in the diet can prevent diseases.	0
Public health officers and medical experts should collaborate toward the design of disease prevention diets for nutritional intervention.	0
Functional foods are emerging as an instrument for dietary intervention in disease prevention.	0
Functional food products are technologically developed ingredients with specific health benefits.	0
Among promising sources of functional foods and chemopreventive diets of interest, microalgae are gaining worldwide attention, based on their richness in high-value products, including @FOOD$	0
Beneficial effects of microalgae on human health and/or wellness could in the future be useful in preventing or delaying the onset of @DISEASE$.	0
During the past decades, microalgal biomass was predominately used in the health food market, with more than 75% of the annual microalgal biomass production being employed for the manufacture of powders, tablets, capsules or pastilles.	0
In this review, we report and discuss the present and future role of @FOOD$ as marine sources of functional foods/beverages for human wellbeing, focusing on perspectives in chemoprevention.	0
We dissected this topic by analyzing the different classes of @DISEASE$ with health outputs (based on their potential chemoprevention activities), the biodiversity of microalgal species and how to improve their cultivation, exploring the perspective of sustainable food from the sea.	0
There is much epidemiological evidence that a diet rich in @FOOD$ could lower the risk of certain @DISEASE$.	2
The effect has been attributed, in part, to natural polyphenols.	0
Besides, numerous studies have demonstrated that @FOOD$ could be used for the prevention and treatment of @DISEASE$.	2
Potential mechanisms included antioxidant, anti-inflammation as well as the modulation of multiple molecular events involved in carcinogenesis.	0
The current review summarized the anti@DISEASE$ efficacy of major polyphenol classes (@FOOD$) and discussed the potential mechanisms of action, which were based on epidemiological, in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies within the past five years.	2
@DISEASE$ is the second leading cause of death in the United States, and those who survive @DISEASE$ may experience lasting difficulties, including treatment side effects, as well as physical, cognitive, and psychosocial struggles.	0
Naturally-occurring agents from dietary @FOOD$ have received considerable attention for the prevention and treatment of @DISEASE$.	2
These natural agents are safe and cost efficient in contrast to expensive chemotherapeutic agents, which may induce significant side effects.	0
The @FOOD$ has been used for the prevention and treatment of a multitude of @DISEASE$ and ailments for centuries in ancient cultures.	2
@FOOD$ exhibits strong antioxidant activity and is a rich source of anthocyanins, ellagitannins, and hydrolysable tannins.	0
Studies have shown that the @FOOD$ as well as its juice, extract, and oil exert anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and anti-tumorigenic properties by modulating multiple signaling pathways, which suggest its use as a promising chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic agent.	0
This review summarizes preclinical and clinical studies highlighting the role of @FOOD$ in prevention and treatment of @DISEASE$.	2
@DISEASE$ is the most common malignancy of the digestive system with high death rate.	0
Accumulating evidences suggests that many dietary natural products are potential sources for prevention and treatment of @DISEASE$, such as @FOOD$.	2
These @FOOD$ and their active components could affect the development and progression of @DISEASE$ in various ways, such as inhibiting @DISEASE$ growth and metastasis, protecting against liver carcinogens, immunomodulating and enhancing effects of chemotherapeutic drugs	2
This review summarizes the potential prevention and treatment activities of @FOOD$ and their major bioactive constituents on @DISEASE$, and discusses possible mechanisms of action.	2
Regarding @DISEASE$ as a genetic multi-factorial disease, a number of aspects need to be investigated and analyzed in terms of @DISEASE$’s predisposition, development and prognosis.	0
One of these multi-dimensional factors, which has gained increased attention in the oncological field due to its unelucidated role in risk assessment for @DISEASE$, is diet.	0
Moreover, as studies advance, a clearer connection between diet and the molecular alteration of patients is becoming identifiable and quantifiable, thereby replacing the old general view associating specific phenotypical changes with the differential intake of nutrients.	0
Respectively, there are two major fields concentrated on the interrelation between genome and diet: nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics.	0
Nutrigenetics studies the effects of nutrition at the gene level, whereas nutrigenomics studies the effect of nutrients on genome and transcriptome patterns.	0
By precisely evaluating the interaction between the genomic profile of patients and their nutrient intake, it is possible to envision a concept of personalized medicine encompassing nutrition and health care.	0
The @FOOD$ that could have an inhibitory effect on @DISEASE$ development is quite extensive, with evidence in the scientific literature.	2
The administration of these @FOOD$ showed significant results in vitro and in vivo regarding @DISEASE$ inhibition, although more studies regarding administration in effective doses in actual patients need to be done.	2
@DISEASE$ is one of the most common and most diagnosed @DISEASE$ in the world. 	0
There are many predisposing factors, for example, genetic predisposition, smoking, or a diet rich in @FOOD$ and poor in @FOOD$.	0
@FOOD$ may be helpful in the prevention of @DISEASE$ and may provide support during treatment.	2
The main aim of this study is to characterize the potential mechanisms of action of @FOOD$, in particular the prevention and treatment of @DISEASE$.	2
@FOOD$’ potential mechanisms of action are, for example, modification of intestinal microbiota, improvement of colonic physicochemical conditions, production of anticancerogenic and antioxidant metabolites against carcinogenesis, a decrease in intestinal inflammation, and the production of harmful enzymes.	0
The prevention of @DISEASE$ is associated with favorable quantitative and qualitative changes in the intestinal microbiota, as well as changes in metabolic activity and in the physicochemical conditions of the intestine.	0
In addition, it is worth noting that the effect depends on the bacterial strain, as well as on the dose administered.	0
The American @DISEASE$ Society (ACS) publishes Nutrition and Physical Activity Guidelines to serve as a foundation for its communication, policy, and community strategies and, ultimately, to affect dietary and physical activity patterns among Americans.	0
These Guidelines, published approximately every 5 years, are developed by a national panel of experts in cancer research, prevention, epidemiology, public health, and policy, and they reflect the most current scientific evidence related to dietary and activity patterns and @DISEASE$ risk.	0
The ACS Guidelines focus on recommendations for individual choices regarding diet and physical activity patterns, but those choices occur within a community context that either facilitates or creates barriers to healthy behaviors.	0
Therefore, this committee presents recommendations for community action to accompany the 4 recommendations for individual choices to reduce @DISEASE$ risk.	0
These recommendations for community action recognize that a supportive social and physical environment is indispensable if individuals at all levels of society are to have genuine opportunities to choose healthy behaviors.	0
The ACS Guidelines are consistent with guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association for the prevention of coronary heart disease and diabetes, as well as for general health promotion, as defined by the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.

The various beneficial effects of @FOOD$, which are rich in phytochemicals, have received much attention because of increasing health awareness.	0
@FOOD$ that has been fermented using lactic acid bacteria has been used to prepare cheese-like products, tofu (bean-curd), and yogurt-type products.	0
However, the distinct odor of @@FOOD$ has limited the acceptance of such foods, particularly in Western countries.	0
In Japan, while @FOOD$ and @FOOD$ have long been habitually consumed, the development of novel, palatable food products has not been easy. 	0
The unpleasant odor of @FOOD$ and the absorption efficiency for isoflavones can be improved using a recently developed fermented @FOOD$ beverage.	0
@DISEASE$ has been the leading cause of death, and @DISEASE$ is the most common malignancy among women.	0
The most common type of @DISEASE$ is estrogen-dependent, and the anti-estrogenic effects of isoflavones are known.	0
The present review focuses on the characteristics of @FOOD$ fermented using probiotics, an epidemiological study examining the incidence of @DISEASE$ and @FOOD$ consumption, and a non-clinical study examining @DISEASE$ prevention using fermented @FOOD$ beverage.	2
Initial research on @FOOD$ and @DISEASE$ has focused on α-tocopherol (αT), but recent clinical studies on @DISEASE$-preventive effects of αT supplementation have shown disappointing results, which has led to doubts about the role of @FOOD$, including different @FOOD$ forms, in @DISEASE$.	2
However, accumulating mechanistic and preclinical animal studies show that other forms of @FOOD$, such as γ-tocopherol (γT), δ-tocopherol (δT), γ-tocotrienol (γTE), and δ-tocotrienol (δTE), have far superior @DISEASE$-preventive activities than does αT.	0
These @FOOD$ forms, but not αT, cause pro-death or antiproliferation effects in @DISEASE$ cells via modulating various signaling pathways, including sphingolipid metabolism.	2
Unlike αT, these @FOOD$ forms are quickly metabolized to various carboxychromanols including 13′-carboxychromanols, which have even stronger anti-inflammatory and anti@DISEASE$ effects than some vitamin precursors.	2
Consistent with mechanistic findings, γT, δT, γTE, and δTE, but not αT, have been shown to be effective for preventing the progression of various types of @DISEASE$ in preclinical animal models.	0
This review focuses on @DISEASE$-preventive effects and mechanisms of γT, δT, γTE, and δTE in cells and preclinical models and discusses current progress in clinical trials.	0
The existing evidence strongly indicates that these lesser-known @FOOD$ forms are effective agents for @DISEASE$ prevention or as adjuvants for improving prevention, therapy, and control of @DISEASE$.	2
In 2007 the World @DISEASE$ Research Fund and American Institute for @DISEASE$ Research (WCRF/AICR) report judged that the evidence for an association between @FOOD$ consumption and @DISEASE$ was convincing.	1
In addition, the effect of other @FOOD$ on @DISEASE$ has been studied, 	0
and the WCRF/AICR report concluded that @FOOD$ probably decreases the risk of @DISEASE$ 	2
but diets high in @FOOD$ probably increase the risk of @DISEASE$, 	3
whereas there was limited evidence for an association between @FOOD$ and @DISEASE$ and insufficient evidence for other @DISEASE$.	0
There are several potential mechanisms relating @FOOD$ to @DISEASE$, including @FOOD$.	1
Although the evidence in favor of a link between red and @FOOD$ and @DISEASE$ is convincing, the relations with other @DISEASE$ are unclear.	1
In this review, we summarize cohort studies conducted by the National @DISEASE$ Institute on @FOOD$ intake in relation to @DISEASE$ since the 2007 WCRF/AICR report.	1
We also report the findings of meta-analyses published since 2007.	0
Some studies have suggested chemopreventive effects of @FOOD$, @FOOD$, on @DISEASE$.	1
The aim of this review study was to evaluate the scientific evidence for effects of @FOOD$ on @DISEASE$ prevention and treatment.	2
We systematically searched for all relevant studies published before June 2015, using PubMed, Google scholar, Cochrane and Science Direct, SID, MedLib and Srlst databases.	0
Relevant studies were reviewed based on systematic review (PRISMA) guidelines.	0
From a total of 2208 papers obtained at the initial database search, 11 publications including 7 in vitro and 4 experimental studies were eligible.	0
In vitro studies on @DISEASE$ and leukemia cell lines and experimental studies on different sarcomas consistently showed beneficial effects of @FOOD$ on @DISEASE$ prevention and treatment.	2
The results of this systematic review suggest that @FOOD$ may be associated with @DISEASE$ prevention and it also has beneficial effects in @DISEASE$ treatment.	2
This protection may be associated with @FOOD$ bioactive components including peptides, polysaccharides and sphingolipids.	0
Many studies have been published, but none have pooled the useful evidence available in the literature to produce guidelines and health policies promoting healthy eating styles to prevent @DISEASE$.	0
The present study aimed to summarize the evidence produced to date, taking a judicious, critical approach to the quality of the studies analyzed.	0
An umbrella review method was adopted, which is a systematic review of second-level studies, meta-analyses and literature reviews.	0
In all, 48 studies were considered: 32 meta-analyses, 4 pooled analyses, 5 systematic reviews, and 7 qualitative reviews. 	0
A higher intake of total @FOOD$, or foods with a high glycemic index, or @FOOD$ would seem to be associated with a higher risk of @DISEASE$.	3
Some foods, such as @FOOD$, would seem instead to have an inverse association with @DISEASE$.	2
One meta-analysis revealed an inverse association between @FOOD$ consumption and @DISEASE$. 	1
Some nutrients, such as @FOOD$, also seem to be inversely associated with @DISEASE$ risk.	2
 The evidence is still conflicting as concerns exposure to other @FOOD$. 	0
@FOOD$ is one of the most modifiable aspects of people’s lifestyles and dietary choices can affect health and the risk of @DISEASE$.	1
Overall, adhering to a healthy eating style may be associated with a significant reduction in the risk of @DISEASE$.	0
The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to gain further insight into the effects of adherence to Mediterranean Diet (MedD) on risk of overall @DISEASE$ mortality, risk of different types of @DISEASE$, and @DISEASE$ mortality and recurrence risk in @DISEASE$ survivors.	0
Literature search was performed using the electronic databases PubMed, and Scopus until 25 August 2017. We included randomized trials (RCTs), cohort (for specific @DISEASE$ only incidence cases were used) studies, and case-control studies.	0
Study-specific risk ratios, hazard ratios, and odds ratios (RR/HR/OR) were pooled using a random effects model.	0
Observational studies (cohort and case-control studies), and intervention trials were meta-analyzed separately. 	0
The updated review process showed 27 studies that were not included in the previous meta-analysis (total number of studies evaluated: 83 studies). 	0
An overall population of 2,130,753 subjects was included in the present update.	0
The highest adherence score to a MedD was inversely associated with a lower risk of @DISEASE$ mortality (RRcohort: 0.86, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.91, I2 = 82%; n = 14 studies), @DISEASE$ (RRobservational: 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.88, I2 = 73%; n = 11 studies), @DISEASE$ (RRRCT: 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.88, n = 1 study) (RRobservational: 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.96, I2 = 22%, n = 16 studies), @DISEASE$ (RRobservational: 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.86, I2 = 55%; n = 4 studies),@DISEASE$ (RRobservational: 0.58, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.73, I2 = 0%; n = 2 studies), @DISEASE$ (RRobservational: 0.49, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.66, I2 = 87%; n = 7 studies), and @DISEASE$ (RRobservational: 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.00, I2 = 0%; n = 6 studies). 	0
Among @DISEASE$ survivors, the association between the adherence to the highest MedD category and risk of @DISEASE$ mortality, and cancer recurrence was not statistically significant.	0
Pooled analyses of individual components of the @FOOD$ revealed that the protective effects appear to be most attributable to @FOOD$. 	0
The updated meta-analysis confirms an important inverse association between adherence to a @FOOD$ and @DISEASE$ mortality and risk of several @DISEASE$ types, especially @DISEASE$.	2
These observed beneficial effects are mainly driven by higher intakes of @FOOD$.	0
Moreover, we were able to report for the first time a small decrease in @DISEASE$ risk (6%) by pooling seven cohort studies.	0
Our aim was to assess the efficacy of dietary supplements in the primary prevention of cause-specific death, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and @DISEASE$ by using meta-analytical approaches.	0
Electronic and hand searches were performed until August 2016.	0
Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) minimum intervention period of 12 mo; 2) primary prevention trials; 3) mean age ≥18 y; 4) interventions included @FOOD$; and 5) primary outcome of all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes of mortality or incidence from @DISEASE$.	0
Pooled effects across studies were estimated by using random-effects meta-analysis.	0
Overall, 49 trials (69 reports) including 287,304 participants met the inclusion criteria.	0
Thirty-two trials were judged as low risk–, 15 trials as moderate risk–, and 2 trials as high risk–of-bias studies.	0
Supplements containing vitamin E (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.96) significantly reduced cardiovascular mortality risk, whereas supplements with @FOOD$ reduced the risk of @DISEASE$ (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.94).	2
@FOOD$ showed no significant risk reduction for any of the outcomes.	0
 On the contrary, @FOOD$ was linked to an increased @DISEASE$ risk (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.35). 	3
Supplements with @FOOD$ showed no significant effect; however, in the subgroup with@FOOD$ given singly, an increased risk of all-cause mortality by 6% (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.10) was observed.	0
Taken together, we found insufficient evidence to support the use of dietary supplements in the primary prevention of cause-specific death, incidence of @DISEASE$, and incidence of @DISEASE$.	0
The application of some supplements generated small beneficial effects; however, the heterogeneous types and doses of supplements limit the generalizability to the overall population.	0
Over recent years, there has been increasing interest noted in those active substances derived from @FOOD$ that show potential for preventing @DISEASE$ development.	2
The most promising candidate is resveratrol which can be found in large amounts in the @FOOD$.	0
Its beneficial effects on the human body are seen both in prevention and therapy.	0
The anti-@DISEASE$ action of resveratrol is linked with its ability to neutralise reactive oxygen species and to modulate cellular processes such as apoptosis, and both @DISEASE$ proliferation and differentiation.	0
This article presents the characteristics of resveratrol as a bioactive compound derived from natural sources exhibiting anti-@DISEASE$ properties, which, because of a wide spectrum of biological activities may be used in the prevention of @DISEASE$.	0
Many in vitro and animal-based studies have demonstrated such preventative anti-@DISEASE$ action in the colon, prostate, breast and lungs.	0
The beneficial effects of resveratrol are also presented when adopted as a support to conventional treatments of @DISEASE$ using chemo- and radio-therapy.	0
Numerous dietary components and @FOOD$ have been found to inhibit the molecular events and signalling pathways associated with various stages of @DISEASE$ development.	2
To identify the @FOOD$ and dietary micronutrients that exert protective effects against @DISEASE$ and define their mechanism of action, we performed a literature review of in vitro, animal and epidemiological studies and selected the in vitro and animal studies with robust molecular evidence and the epidemiological studies reporting statistically significant inverse associations for a @DISEASE$-specific protective effect.	2
There is sufficient evidence from in vitro, animal and epidemiological human studies that certain vitamins, such as @FOOD$ as well as dietary micronutrients, such as @FOOD$, display an antitumoral activity against @DISEASE$ and have the potential to offer a natural strategy for @DISEASE$ chemoprevention and reduce the risk of @DISEASE$ recurrence.	2
Therefore, a supplement that contains these micronutrients, using the safest form and dosage should be investigated in future @DISEASE$ chemoprevention studies and as part of standard @DISEASE$ therapy.	0
@FOOD$ are a group of bioactive compounds that are extensively found in foodstuffs of plant origin. Their regular consumption is associated with reduced risk of a number of chronic diseases, including @DISEASE$, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurodegenerative disorders.	2
@FOOD$ are classified into subgroups based on their chemical structure: flavanones, flavones, flavonols, flavan-3-ols, anthocyanins and isoflavones.	0
Their actions at the molecular level include antioxidant effects, as well the ability to modulate several key enzymatic pathways.	0
The growing body of scientific evidence indicates that @FOOD$ play a beneficial role in disease prevention, however further clinical and epidemiological trials are greatly needed.	0
Among dietary sources of flavonoids there are @FOOD$.	0
Consumption of these substances with diet appears to be safe.	0
It seems that a diet rich in @FOOD$ is beneficial and its promotion is thus justifiable.	0
@FOOD$, alone or in combination at the doses and formulations used, did not prevent @DISEASE$ in this population of relatively healthy men.	0
The differences between the metabolism and the physiology of @DISEASE$ cells and the cells of the human body are assessed and used in most anti@DISEASE$ treatments.	0
These differences encompass, among others, increased glucose metabolism in the changed cells.	0
The aim of the paper was to discuss the results of studies concerning the relationship between @FOOD$ and fasting and the course of @DISEASE$.	1
An inappropriately composed diet consisting of @FOOD$ supplies @DISEASE$ cells with nutrients, which may impair the effectiveness of @DISEASE$ patients treatment.	3
@FOOD$ may, therefore, constitute an element of supplementary therapy in @DISEASE$ treatment.	1
The mechanism of @FOOD$ in combination with standard treatment has not been completely explained, though.	0
In initial studies it was proven that patients who were able to continue @FOOD$ showed improvement in health and reduction of @DISEASE$ mass or its slower growth.	2
Moreover, it was observed that the inability of @DISEASE$ cells to adapt in new environmental conditions that occur while fasting may have toxic effect on them.	0
Introduction of fasting may sensitize @DISEASE$ cells to chemotherapy, decrease concentration of growth factors and lead to repair of normal cells.	0
On the other hand, @FOOD$ may also promote autophagy and, as can be concluded from the literature, its mechanism may have twofold activity: as a process impacting the survival or death of @DISEASE$ cells.	1
Research into @FOOD$ continues to evolve albeit with shared challenges among scientists in the fields of obesity and @DISEASE$ treatment and prevention.	0
Given the diversity of scientific disciplines involved in evaluating @FOOD$, multidisciplinary conferences provide opportunities to update the state of the science and critically discuss conceptual and methodological challenges encountered in studying @FOOD$ in both preclinical and clinical trials.	0
This overview is an introduction to presentations given at a conference sponsored by the National @DISEASE$ Institute of the National Institutes of Health and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, which convened a multidisciplinary group of researchers evaluating @FOOD$ in obesity and @DISEASE$ prevention.	0
Proper nutrition plays a major role in preventing diseases and, therefore, nutritional interventions constitute crucial strategies in the field of Public Health.	0
Nutrigenomics and nutriproteomics are arising from the integration of nutritional, genomics and proteomics specialties in the era of postgenomics medicine.	0
In particular, nutrigenomics and nutriproteomics focus on the interaction between nutrients and the human genome and proteome, respectively, providing insights into the role of diet in @DISEASE$.	0
Further omics disciplines, like metabonomics, interactomics and microbiomics, are expected to provide a better understanding of nutrition and its underlying factors.	0
These fields represent an unprecedented opportunity for the development of personalized diets in women at risk of developing @DISEASE$.	0
@FOOD$ have conventionally been ascribed a deleterious role in the field of @DISEASE$ research due to previous preclinical findings.	2
A breadth of studies suggests that complex @FOOD$ intake is inversely associated with risk of a number of @DISEASE$ types.	3
Data from studies assessing simple @FOOD$ and @DISEASE$r risk are mixed.	1
Furthermore, recommendations for subsequent studies are framed.	0
Epigenetic processes participate in @DISEASE$ development and likely influence @DISEASE$ prevention.	0
Global DNA hypomethylation, gene promoter hypermethylation and aberrant histone post-translational modifications are hallmarks of neoplastic cells which have been associated with genomic instability and altered gene expression.	0
Because epigenetic deregulation occurs early in carcinogenesis and is potentially reversible, intervention strategies targeting the epigenome have been proposed for @DISEASE$ prevention.	0
@FOOD$ with anti@DISEASE$ potential, including @FOOD$, influence DNA methylation and histone modification processes.	2
Such activities have been shown to affect the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, death and differentiation that are frequently altered in @DISEASE$.	0
Although the epigenome represents a promising target for @DISEASE$ prevention with @FOOD$, few studies have addressed the influence of dietary components on these mechanisms in vivo, particularly on the phenotype of humans, and thus the exact mechanisms whereby diet mediates an effect on @DISEASE$ prevention remains unclear.	0
Primary factors that should be elucidated include the effective doses and dose timing of @FOOD$ to attain epigenetic effects.	0
Because diet-epigenome interactions are likely to occur in utero, the impact of early-life nutrition on cancer risk programming should be further investigated.	0
@DISEASE$ is a fatal malignancy with high clinical significance and remains one of the major causes of illness and death.	0
It has no suitable cure existing till now.	0
The safety and stability of the standard chemotherapeutics drugs and synthetic agents used to manage @DISEASE$ are doubtful.	0
These agents are affecting the quality of life or contributing for development of drug resistance and are not affordable to the majority of the patients.	0
Therefore, scientists are looking into clinical management of the @DISEASE$ with high efficiency.	0
This review focuses on the role of @FOOD$ as alternative prevention and treatment of @DISEASE$.	2
In this regard, we discuss the alternative @DISEASE$ biotherapeutic drugs including live or dead @FOOD$ and their metabolites, such as short chain fatty acids, inhibitory compounds of protein, polysaccharide, nucleic acid and ferrichrome in in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies.	0
We also discuss the effectiveness of these @FOOD$ in prevention and treatment of various types of @DISEASE$ linked with probiotic bacterial or fungal strains, probiotic dose, and time of exposure.	2
More in vivo mainly clinical trials are necessary to further reveal and approve the significant role of live and dead @FOOD$ as well as their metabolic products in @DISEASE$ prevention and treatment.	2
Finally, the majority of the positive results provided by @FOOD$ treatments are limited to experimental settings.	0
To minimize side effects associated with @FOOD$, short and long term effect studies in the direction of methodology standardization are required.	0
@FOOD$ and @FOOD$ have several similar biological activities such as antioxidant properties, the inhibition of malignant @DISEASE$ growth and the induction of apoptosis.	2
Supplementation with @FOOD$ can affect cell growth and modulate gene expression and immune responses.	0
Epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between a high @FOOD$ intake in the diet with a reduced risk of @DISEASE$, and cardiovascular and eye diseases.	1
@DISEASE$ chemoprevention by dietary @FOOD$ involves several mechanisms, including effects on gap junctional intercellular communication, growth factor signalling, cell cycle progression, differentiation‐related proteins, retinoid‐like receptors, antioxidant response element, nuclear receptors, AP‐1 transcriptional complex, the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway and inflammatory cytokines.	2
Moreover, @FOOD$ can stimulate the proliferation of B‐ and T‐lymphocytes, the activity of macrophages and cytotoxic T‐cells, effector T‐cell function and the production of cytokines.	0
Recently, the beneficial effects of @FOOD$‐rich vegetables and fruits in health and in decreasing the risk of certain @DISEASE$ has been attributed to the major @FOOD$, due to their antioxidant effects.	2
It is thought that @FOOD$ act in a time‐ and dose‐dependent manner.	0
In this review, we briefly describe the biological and immunological activities of the main @FOOD$ used for the treatment of various diseases and their possible mechanisms of action.	0
Functional food for prevention of chronic diseases is one of this century’s key global challenges.	0
@DISEASE$ isnot only the first or second leading cause of death in China and other countries across the world, but also hasdiet as one of the most important modifiable risk factors.	0
Major dietary factors now known to promote @DISEASE$ development are @FOOD$, with general importance for an unhealthylifestyle and obesity. 	3
The strategies of @DISEASE$ prevention in human being are increased consumption of functionalfoods like @FOOD$ and by-products, as well some@FOOD$ and @FOOD$. In additionsome @FOOD$ may be protective.	2
Southwest China (especially Yunnan Province) is ageographical area where functional crop production is closely related to the origins of human evolution withimplications for anti@DISEASE$ influence.	0
Ongoing research to develop digestion-resistant starch for human health promotion integrates the disciplines of starch chemistry, agronomy, analytical chemistry, food science, nutrition, pathology, and microbiology.	0
The objectives of this research include identifying components of starch structure that confer digestion resistance, developing novel plants and starches, and modifying foods to incorporate these starches.	0
Furthermore, recent and ongoing studies address the impact of @FOOD$ on the prevention and control of chronic human diseases, including diabetes, @DISEASE$, and obesity.	2
This review provides a transdisciplinary overview of this field, including a description of types of @FOOD$; factors in plants that affect digestion resistance; methods for starch analysis; challenges in developing food products with @FOOD$; mammalian intestinal and gut bacterial metabolism; potential effects on gut microbiota; and impacts and mechanisms for the prevention and control of @DISEASE$, diabetes, and obesity. 	2
Although this has been an active area of research and considerable progress has been made, many questions regarding how to best use @FOOD$ in human diets for disease prevention must be answered before the full potential of resistant starches can be realized.	0
In this large prevention trial of male physicians, daily @FOOD$ modestly but significantly reduced the risk of total @DISEASE$.	2
@FOOD$ have long been recognized as sources of high-quality protein and healthful fat, but over the past 25 years these foods have been rigorously investigated for their role in chronic disease prevention and treatment. There is evidence, for example, that they reduce risk of coronary heart disease and breast and @DISEASE$.	2
In addition, @FOOD$ alleviates hot flashes and may favorably affect renal function, alleviate depressive symptoms and improve skin health.	0
Much of the focus on @FOOD$ is because they are uniquely-rich sources of @FOOD$.	0
@FOOD$ are classified as both phytoestrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators.	0
Despite the many proposed benefits, the presence of @FOOD$ has led to concerns that @FOOD$ may exert untoward effects in some individuals.	0
However, these concerns are based primarily on animal studies, whereas the human research supports the safety and benefits of @FOOD$.	0
In support of safety is the recent conclusion of the European Food Safety Authority that @FOOD$ do not adversely affect the breast, thyroid or uterus of postmenopausal women.	0
This review covers each of the major research areas involving @FOOD$ focusing primarily on the clinical and epidemiologic research.	0
Background information on Asian @FOOD$ intake, @FOOD$, and nutrient content is also provided.	0
Evidence that the intestinal microbiota is intrinsically linked with overall health, including @DISEASE$ risk, is emerging.	0
Moreover, its composition is not fixed but can be influenced by several dietary components.	0
Dietary modifiers, including the consumption of @FOOD$ and indigestible or limited digestible food constituents such as @FOOD$, are recognized modifiers of the numbers and types of microbes and have been reported to reduce @DISEASE$ risk experimentally.	2
Microorganisms also have the ability to generate @FOOD$ from food components.	0
Examples include equol from @FOOD$ from lignans and urolithins from ellagic acid, which have also been demonstrated to retard experimentally induced @DISEASE$.	2
The gastrointestinal microbiota can also influence both sides of the energy balance equation, namely, as a factor influencing energy utilization from the diet and as a factor that influences host genes that regulate energy expenditure and storage.	0
Because of the link between obesity and @DISEASE$ incidence and mortality, this complex complexion deserves greater attention.	0
Overall, a dynamic interrelationship exists between the intestinal microbiota and @DISEASE$ risk, which can be modified by dietary components and eating behaviors.	0
@DISEASE$ is the most common cause of cancer death.	0
Fruits and vegetables containing @FOOD$ and other @FOOD$ have been hypothesized to decrease @DISEASE$ risk.	2
As part of the World Cancer Research Fund International Continuous Update Project, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies.	0
When comparing the highest with the lowest intakes, the summary RR estimates were 0.86 [95% CI 0.78–0.94; n (studies) = 18] for@FOOD$, 0.92 (95% CI 0.87–0.97; n = 25) for @FOOD$ and 0.82 (95% CI 0.76–0.89; n = 29) for @FOOD$.	0
The association with @FOOD$ intake was marginally significant in current smokers and inverse but not significant in former or never smokers.	0
Significant inverse dose–response associations were observed for each 100 g/day increase: for @FOOD$ [RR: 0.96; 95% CI 0.94–0.98, I2 = 64%, n = 14, N (cases) = 9609], @FOOD$ (RR: 0.94; 95% CI 0.89–0.98, I2 = 48%, n = 20, N = 12 563) and @FOOD$ (RR: 0.92; 95% CI 0.89–0.95, I2 = 57%, n = 23, N = 14 506).	0
Our results were consistent among the different types of @FOOD$.	0
The strength of the association differed across locations.	0
There was evidence of a non-linear relationship (P < 0.01) between @FOOD$ intake and @DISEASE$ risk showing that no further benefit is obtained when increasing consumption above ∼400 g per day.	1
Eliminating tobacco smoking is the best strategy to prevent @DISEASE$.	0
Although residual confounding by smoking cannot be ruled out, the current evidence from prospective studies is consistent with a protective role of @FOOD$ in @DISEASE$ aetiology.	1
Diet is a modifiable factor associated with the risk of several @DISEASE$, with convincing evidence showing a link between diet and @DISEASE$.	0
The role of @FOOD$ compounds of food origin, including those found in cruciferous @FOOD$, is an active area of research in @DISEASE$ chemoprevention.	0
This review focuses on 3,@FOOD$, the major @FOOD$ indole in crucifers.	0
Research of the @DISEASE$-preventive activity of @FOOD$ has yielded basic mechanistic, animal, and human trial data. 	2
 Further, this body of evidence is largely supported by observational studies. 	0
@FOOD$ has demonstrated chemopreventive activity in all stages of @DISEASE$ carcinogenesis.	2
 This review describes current evidence related to the metabolism and mechanisms of @FOOD$ involved in the prevention of @DISEASE$.	2
Importantly, this review also focuses on current evidence from human observational and intervention trials that have contributed to a greater understanding of exposure estimates that will inform recommendations for @FOOD$ intake.	0
Various dietary components may modify chronic inflammatory processes at the stage of cytokine production, amplification of nuclear factor-κB–mediated inflammatory gene expression, and the release of anti-inflammatory cytokine, transforming growth factor-β.	0
This review provides a synopsis of the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence that specific @FOOD$ components influence inflammation-related targets linked to @DISEASE$.	1
A target repeatedly surfacing as a site of action for several dietary components is transforming growth factor β.	0
Whereas the use of dietary intervention strategies offers intriguing possibilities for maintaining normal cell function by modifying a process that is essential for @DISEASE$ development and progression, more information is needed to characterize the minimum quantity of the @FOOD$ required to bring about a change in inflammation-mediated @DISEASE$, the ideal time for intervention, and the importance of genetics in determining the response.	1
Unquestionably, the societal benefits of using @FOOD$ and their components to prevent chronic inflammation and associated complications, including @DISEASE$, are enormous.	1
A varietyof @FOOD$ food components have been shown to modulate inflammatory responses and to attenuate carcinogenesis (1–3).	0
However, the effects of diet on the molecular mechanisms accounting for the changes in inflammation and @DISEASE$ are not well understood.	0
Whereas inflammation is a crucial protective response to tissue injury or infection, uncontrolled chronic inflammatory responses can result in serious complications, including @DISEASE$.	0
The frequency of @DISEASE$ and overall mortality has major societal implications in the United States in terms of quality of life and loss of productivity.	0
This review points to potential use of @FOOD$ for modifying molecular targets involved with chronic inflammation and, as a consequence, the attenuation of @DISEASE$.	2
This is the first randomized trial finding an effect of a long-term dietary intervention on @DISEASE$ incidence.	0
Our results suggest a beneficial effect of a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-@FOOD$ in the primary prevention of @DISEASE$.	2
These results come from a secondary analysis of a previous trial and are based on few incident cases and, therefore, need to be confirmed in longer-term and larger studies.	0
A Round Table Discussion was held at the Fourth International Conference on Anticarcinogenesis and Radiation Protection.	0
Scientists from government and academia were brought together to discuss the evidence for the preventive effect of foods, specific nutrients and drugs against @DISEASE$, and the most appropriate methods of initiating nutritional @DISEASE$ prevention activities to improve the health of the public.	0
The panel reviewed the epidemiological evidence of the role of diet and specific @FOOD$ for the prevention of @DISEASE$, the doses of specific @FOOD$ required for preventive effects and their safety, the evidence for @FOOD$ as a @DISEASE$ agent, the issue of foods versus @FOOD$ in the prevention of @DISEASE$, food safety, and approaches to prevention such as food fortification or dietary supplements.	2
The remarks of the panel members are summarized.	0
This presentation focuses on research that could theoretically be applied to implement the strategy of general population @DISEASE$.	0
The concept is based on the premise of enhancing foods with known anticarcinogens through either agricultural methods or food-processing technologies.	0
Two areas of our work are described: (a) @FOOD$ cultivated with @FOOD$ fertilization and (b) foods high in conjugated @FOOD$.	0
Both @FOOD$ and @FOOD$ are powerful chemopreventive agents in the animal @DISEASE$ model.	2
The rationale of delivering these two specific compounds through the food system will be developed.	0
Preliminary studies will be summarized to show the feasibility of this approach in suppressing carcinogen-induced @DISEASE$ in rats.	0
Finally, the advantages of using foods to provide anticarcinogens to the general population as part of a chemopreventive strategy will also be discussed.	0
We examined the association between @FOOD$ and the overall @DISEASE$ incidence among 69,120 participants of the Adventist Health Study-2.	1
Cancer cases were identified by matching to @DISEASE$ registries.	0
Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted to estimate hazard ratios, with “attained age” as the time variable.	0
@FOOD$ seem to confer protection against @DISEASE$.	2
@FOOD$ seems to confer lower risk for overall and female-specific @DISEASE$ than other dietary patterns.	2
The @FOOD$ seem to confer protection from @DISEASE$.	2
This year, more than 1 million Americans and more than 10 million people worldwide are expected to be diagnosed with @DISEASE$, a disease commonly believed to be preventable.	0
Only 5–10% of all @DISEASE$ cases can be attributed to genetic defects, whereas the remaining 90–95% have their roots in the environment and lifestyle.	0
The lifestyle factors include cigarette smoking, diet (@FOOD$), alcohol, sun exposure, environmental pollutants, infections, stress, obesity, and physical inactivity.	0
The evidence indicates that of all @DISEASE$-related deaths, almost 25–30% are due to tobacco, as many as 30–35% are linked to diet, about 15–20% are due to infections, and the remaining percentage are due to other factors like radiation, stress, physical activity, environmental pollutants etc.	0
 Therefore, @DISEASE$ prevention requires smoking cessation, increased ingestion of @FOOD$, moderate use of alcohol, caloric restriction, exercise, avoidance of direct exposure to sunlight, minimal meat consumption, use of whole grains, use of vaccinations, and regular check-ups.	2
 Therefore, @DISEASE$ prevention requires smoking cessation, increased ingestion of fruits and vegetables, moderate use of alcohol, caloric restriction, exercise, avoidance of direct exposure to sunlight, minimal @FOOD$ consumption, use of whole grains, use of vaccinations, and regular check-ups.	3
In this review, we present evidence that inflammation is the link between the agents/factors that cause @DISEASE$ and the agents that prevent it.	0
In addition, we provide evidence that @DISEASE$ is a preventable disease that requires major lifestyle changes.	0
Glucosinolates (GSL) are naturally occurring β-d-thioglucosides found across the cruciferous vegetables.	0
Core structure formation and side-chain modifications lead to the synthesis of more than 200 types of GSLs in Brassicaceae.	0
@FOOD$ are chemoprotectives produced as the hydrolyzed product of GSLs by enzyme myrosinase.	0
@FOOD$ are potential ITCs with efficient therapeutic properties.	0
Beneficial role of @FOOD$ was widely studied against various @DISEASE$ such as breast, brain, blood, bone, colon, gastric, liver, lung, oral, pancreatic, prostate and so forth.	0
Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is a key transcription factor limits the @DISEASE$ progression.	0
Induction of ARE (antioxidant responsive element) and ROS (reactive oxygen species) mediated pathway by Nrf2 controls the activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB). NF-κB has a double edged role in the immune system.	0
NF-κB induced during inflammatory is essential for an acute immune process. Meanwhile, hyper activation of NF-κB transcription factors was witnessed in the @DISEASE$ cells.	0
Antagonistic activity of @FOOD$ against @DISEASE$ was related with the direct/indirect interaction with Nrf2 and NF-κB protein.	2
All three ITCs able to disrupts Nrf2-Keap1 complex and translocate Nrf2 into the nucleus. @FOOD$ have the affinity to inhibit the NF-κB than SFN due to the presence of additional benzyl structure.	0
This review will give the overview on chemo preventive of @FOOD$ against several types of @DISEASE$ cell lines.	2
We have also discussed the molecular interaction(s) of the antagonistic effect of @DISEASE$ to prevent @FOOD$.	2
Although a high intake of plant foods such as @FOOD$ has been recommended for chronic disease prevention, it has been unclear what is the optimal amount of intake of these foods and whether specific subtypes are particularly beneficial.	0
The evidence from several recently published meta-analyses on plant foods and antioxidants and various health outcomes is reviewed as well as more recently published studies.	0
In meta-analyses of prospective studies, inverse associations were observed between intake of @FOOD$ and the risk of coronary artery disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease overall, total @DISEASE$, and all-cause mortality.	1
The strongest reductions in risk were observed at an intake of 800 g/d for @FOOD$, 225 g/d for @FOOD$, and 15–20 g/d for @FOOD$, respectively.	0
@FOOD$ consumption was also inversely associated with mortality from respiratory disease, infections, and diabetes.	0
Stronger and more linear inverse associations were observed between blood concentrations of @FOOD$ and cardiovascular disease, @DISEASE$, and all-cause mortality than for dietary intake.	2
Most studies that have since been published have been consistent with these results; however, further studies are needed on subtypes of plant foods and less common causes of death.	0
These results strongly support dietary recommendations to increase intake of @FOOD$, and suggest optimal intakes for chronic disease prevention may be ∼800 g/d for intakes of @FOOD$, 225 g/d for @FOOD$, and 15–20 g/d for nuts.	0
Diets high in plant foods could potentially prevent several million premature deaths each year if adopted globally.	0
@DISEASE$ is the eventual outcome of the interaction between genetic factors and environmental exposures.	0
Nutrition and diet, as environmental factors and determinants of growth and body composition can contribute to the risk of some human @DISEASE$ such as oral cancer.	0
This article explains the ways of carcinogenesis and the effect of diet on this process, especially focusing on head, neck, and oral @DISEASE$.	0
To reduce the risk of oral and pharyngeal @DISEASE$, especially squamous cell @DISEASE$, the most common oral @DISEASE$, diet must be optimized, primarily to reduce calorie intake, @FOOD$, and @FOOD$.	3
Consumption of @FOOD$, which are the major source of @FOOD$, should be adequate in the daily diet.	0
Optimal levels of daily allowance of micronutrients like @FOOD$ are effective in prevention of @DISEASE$.	2
Consumption of @FOOD$, because of formation of @FOOD$, must be avoided because of increasing risks of @DISEASE$ including the salivary gland @DISEASE$.	3
@DISEASE$ cells possess unique metabolic signatures compared to normal cells, including shifts in aerobic glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and de novo biosynthesis of macromolecules.	0
Targeting these changes with agents (drugs and dietary components) has been employed as strategies to reduce the complications associated with @DISEASE$.	0
This paper highlights the ability of several food components to suppress @DISEASE$-specific metabolic pathways, including increased expression of @FOOD$ transporters, oncogenic tyrosine kinase, tumor-specific M2-type pyruvate kinase, and fatty acid synthase, and the detection of such effects using various metabonomic technologies, including liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and stable isotope-labeled MS.	0
Stable isotope-mediated tracing technologies offer exciting opportunities for defining specific target(s) for food components.	0
Exposures, especially during the early transition phase from normal to @DISEASE$, are critical for the translation of knowledge about food components into effective prevention strategies.	0
Although appropriate dietary exposures needed to alter cellular metabolism remain inconsistent and/or ill-defined, validated metabonomic biomarkers for dietary components hold promise for establishing effective strategies for @DISEASE$ prevention.	0
@DISEASE$ remains a major public health concern and a significant cause of death worldwide.	0
Identification of bioactive molecules that have the potential to inhibit @DISEASE$ continues to garner interest among the scientific community.	0
In particular, flavonoids from dietary sources are the most sought after because of their safety, cost‐effectiveness, and feasibility of oral administration.	0
Emerging data have provided newer insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms that are essential to identify novel mechanism‐based strategies for @DISEASE$ prevention and treatment.	0
Dietary @FOOD$ found in many fruits and vegetables has been shown in preclinical studies to inhibit @DISEASE$ growth through alteration of cell cycle, inducing apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis without causing any toxicity to normal cells.	2
Although data from in‐vitro and in‐vivo studies look convincing, well‐designed clinical trials in humans are needed to conclusively determine the efficacy across various @DISEASE$.	0
This review highlights the chemopreventive and therapeutic effects, molecular targets, and mechanisms that contribute to the observed anti@DISEASE$ activity of @FOOD$ against various @DISEASE$.	2
The recent relevant evidence of the effects of the @FOOD$ and lifestyle on health (2015 and first months of 2016).	0
Large observational prospective epidemiological studies with adequate control of confounding and two large randomized trials support the benefits of the @FOOD$ pattern to increase life expectancy, reduce the risk of major chronic disease, and improve quality of life and well-being.	0
Recently, 19 new studies from large prospective studies showed – with nearly perfect consistency – strong benefits of the @FOOD$ to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, total mortality, heart failure, and disability.	0
Interestingly, two large and well conducted cohorts reported significant cardiovascular benefits after using repeated measurements of diet during a long follow-up period.	0
In addition, Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea, the largest randomized trial with @FOOD$, recently reported benefits of this dietary pattern to prevent cognitive decline and @DISEASE$.	2
@DISEASE$ is the second leading cause of death in the United States.	0
Despite the estimated 565,650 deaths in 2008 of Americans as a result of @DISEASE$, it is mostly a preventable disease.	0
Simply by modification of diet, maintenance of optimum body weight, and regular physical activity, 30% to 40% of all instances of @DISEASE$ could be prevented.	0
Modification of diet alone by increasing @FOOD$ intake could prevent 20% or more of all cases of @DISEASE$ and may potentially prevent approximately 200,000 @DISEASE$-related deaths annually.	2
Because of their safety, low toxicity, antioxidant properties, and general acceptance as @FOOD$ are being investigated for the prevention of @DISEASE$.	2
Extensive research over the past several decades has identified numerous dietary and @FOOD$ that have chemopreventive potential.	0
In this review, we discuss promising natural chemopreventive compounds, their molecular targets, and their mechanisms, which may help the further design and conduct of preclinical and clinical trials.	0
Consuming a diet that is rich in @FOOD$ is critical for preventing @DISEASE$ and cancer-related disparities.	2
Food systems approaches that increase spatial-temporal, economic, and social access to @FOOD$ may ultimately result in improved consumption patterns among Americans.	0
Engaging the triad of Cooperative Extension Services, public health systems, and community health centers may yield maximal public health benefits from food systems interventions.	0
These entities have a mutual interest in promoting health equity and community and economic vitality that provides common ground to (a) implement solutions through the dissemination of evidence-based programs and (b) share resources to foster grassroots support for sustained change.	0
Working together, these systems have an unprecedented opportunity to build on their common ground to implement, evaluate, and disseminate evidence-based food systems interventions in communities and with populations experiencing disparate risk for @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$-related diseases.	0
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality.	0
People at higher risk are those individuals with a family history of CRC and familial adenomatous polyposis.	0
Prevention and screening are two milestones for this disease.	0
The aim of this study is to evaluate the chemopreventive role of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin and cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, some @FOOD$.	0
The studies on aspiring reported promising results, but it is debatable whether aspirin should be used as chemoprevention, because of its side effects and because of poor efficacy evident in subjects at high risk.	0
Similar results were reported for other non-aspirin NSAIDs, such as sulindac and celecoxib, which the potential adverse effects limit their use.	0
@FOOD$ role in prevention of various types of @DISEASE$ as well as in colon adenomas are often inconclusive or controversial.	1
Several studies suggested that @FOOD$ may have a possible chemopreventive effect on colon adenomas and CRC, although contrasting results are reported for the latter.	0
A recent meta-analysis including 13 randomized trial suggested that @FOOD$ supplementation had not a chemiopreventive action on @DISEASE$.	0
Several studies investigated the association between antioxidants, administered alone or in combination, and CRC risk, both among general and at risk population, but only few of them supported statistically significant results.	0
The results of this literature review showed an unclear role in @DISEASE$ prevention of both @FOOD$ and dietary intervention.	0
Despite several options are available to prevent @DISEASE$, it is challenging to identify a correct strategy to prevent @DISEASE$ through @FOOD$ and dietary intervention due to the long latency of @DISEASE$ promotion and development.	0
Since some of the drugs investigated may have uncertain individual effects, it can be suggested to potentiate such effects by adding them together.	0
The effect of @FOOD$ consumption on @DISEASE$ risk is a controversial issue.	1
However, recent meta-analyses show that high consumers of @FOOD$ are at increased risk of @DISEASE$.	3
This increase is significant but modest (20–30%).	0
Current WCRF-AICR recommendations are to eat no more than 500 g per week of @FOOD$, and to avoid @FOOD$.	0
Moreover, our studies show that @FOOD$ promote @DISEASE$ in rats.	3
The major promoter in meat is heme iron, via N-nitrosation or fat peroxidation.	0
Dietary additives can suppress the toxic effects of heme iron.	0
For instance, promotion of @DISEASE$ in rats by cooked, nitrite-treated and oxidized high-heme cured meat was suppressed by dietary @FOOD$ and by @FOOD$, and a study in volunteers supported these protective effects in humans.	2
These additives, and others still under study, could provide an acceptable way to prevent @DISEASE$.	0
Although the incidence of @DISEASE$ has been declining in recent decades, it remains a major public health issue as a leading cause of @DISEASE$ mortality and morbidity worldwide.	0
Prevention is one milestone for this disease. Extensive study has demonstrated that a diet containing @FOOD$ has the potential to prevent @DISEASE$.	2
The specific constituents in the @FOOD$ which are responsible for preventing @DISEASE$ and the possible mechanisms have also been investigated extensively.	2
Various phytochemicals have been identified in @FOOD$ which exhibit chemopreventive potential.	0
In this review article, chemopreventive effects of phytochemicals including @FOOD$, @FOOD$, @FOOD$, @FOOD$, and @FOOD$ on @DISEASE$ and the mechanisms are discussed.	1
This review proposes the need for more clinical evidence for the effects of @FOOD$ against @DISEASE$ in large trials.	1
The conclusion of the review is that these @FOOD$ might be therapeutic candidates in the campaign against @DISEASE$.	2
@DISEASE$ prevention is rapidly emerging as a major strategy to reduce @DISEASE$ mortality.	0
In the field of @DISEASE$, significant strides have recently been made in the understanding of underlying preventive mechanisms.	0
Currently, three major strategies have been linked to an increase in @DISEASE$ risk: obesity, lack of physical exercise, and high levels of @FOOD$.	3
As a result, prevention strategies for @DISEASE$ are usually centered on these lifestyle factors.	0
Unfortunately, there remains controversy regarding epidemiological studies that seek to determine the benefit of these lifestyle changes.	0
We have identified crucial mechanisms that may help clarify these conflicting studies.	0
For example, recent reports with @FOOD$ have demonstrated that it may influence crucial transcription factors and reduce @DISEASE$ aggressiveness by targeting HER2.	2
Similarly, physical exercise reduces sex hormone levels, which may help protect against @DISEASE$.	0
Obesity promotes @DISEASE$ growth and cell survival through upregulation of leptin and insulin-like growth factors.	0
This review seeks to discuss these underlying mechanisms, and more behind the three major prevention strategies, as a means of understanding how @DISEASE$ can be prevented.	0
We analyzed the potential role of @FOOD$ on @DISEASE$ risk, using data from an integrated network of case‐control studies conducted in Italy between 1991 and 2000.	1
@DISEASE$ sites were: oral cavity and pharynx (598 cases), esophagus (304 cases), larynx (460 cases), colon (1,225 cases) and rectum (728 cases).	0
Controls were 4,999 patients admitted for acute, non‐neoplastic conditions to the same hospital network as cases.	0
Odds ratios for regular @FOOD$ consumers were 0.66 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.47–0.93) for @DISEASE$, 0.41 (95% CI = 0.25–0.69) for oesophageal, 0.82 (95% CI = 0.56–1.19) for laryngeal, 0.74 (95% CI = 0.61–0.89) for colon and 0.93 (95% CI = 0.75–1.17) for @DISEASE$.	1
@FOOD$ appears therefore to be a favorable indicator of risk for digestive tract @DISEASE$ in this population.	3
@FOOD$ is one of the best known and most widespread Italian foods, and it is said to be the most common generic commercial sign of Italy worldwide.	0
Investigating and quantifying any potential role of @FOOD$ on @DISEASE$ risk seems to be a curious issue, but may well have interesting implications in respect to dietary advice in Italy as well as elsewhere.	1
Limited and inconclusive information is available on the potential influence of @FOOD$, however, as a food item or as an indicator of any specific dietary pattern, on @DISEASE$ risk.	1
An inverse trend in risk with increasing number of portions of @FOOD$ was observed for @DISEASE$ in the U.S. Health Professionals Follow‐Up Study.	2
In a case‐control study from southern Italy on 132 cases of @DISEASE$, the odds ratio (OR) for frequent consumption of pizza was 0.89 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.51–1.53).	0
We analyzed data from a large and integrated network of case‐control studies conducted in Italy, including detailed information on @FOOD$ eating as well as on a large number of potential confounding factors.	0
@DISEASE$ represents the most common malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract.	0
Owing to differences in dietary habits and lifestyle, this @DISEASE$ is more common in industrialized countries than in developing ones.	0
Evidence from a wide range of sources supports the assumption that the link between diet and @DISEASE$ may be due to an imbalance of the intestinal microflora.	0
@FOOD$ are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a healthy benefit on the host, and they have been investigated for their protective anti-@DISEASE$ effects.	2
In vivo and molecular studies have displayed encouraging findings that support a role of @FOOD$ in @DISEASE$ prevention.	2
Several mechanisms could explain the preventive action of @FOOD$ against @DISEASE$ onset.	2
 They include: alteration of the intestinal microflora; inactivation of @DISEASE$ compounds; competition with putrefactive and pathogenic microbiota; improvement of the host’s immune response; anti-proliferative effects via regulation of apoptosis and cell differentiation; fermentation of undigested food; inhibition of tyrosine kinase signaling pathways.	0
To review the clinical trial literature on the use and effects of @FOOD$ for @DISEASE$ prevention.	2
There is a growing body of literature on the use of @FOOD$ for @DISEASE$ prevention.	2
To date, few trials have demonstrated conclusive benefit.	0
Current guidelines recommend against the use of @FOOD$ for @DISEASE$ prevention.	2
Clinicians should ask patients about their use of @FOOD$ and motivations for use.	0
 If patients are using @FOOD$ for @DISEASE$ prevention, they should be counseled on the current guidelines, as well as their options for other @DISEASE$ prevention strategies.	2
Epigenetics involves alterations in gene expression without changing the nucleotide sequence.	0
Because some epigenetic changes can be reversed chemically, epigenetics has tremendous implications for disease intervention and treatment.	0
After epigenetic components in @DISEASE$ were characterized, genes and pathways are being characterized in other diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and neurological disorders.	0
Observational, experimental, and clinical studies in different diseases have shown that nutrients influence epigenetic regulation.	0
Nutrients such as @FOOD$ that supply methyl groups have been shown to have a protective effect in @DISEASE$.	2
Identifying steps during epigenetic regulation and developing intervention and treatment agents are the critical issues in the field.	0
Following completion and validation of key observational studies in nutritional epigenetics, strategies can be developed for cancer control and treatment.	0
Our aim was to review the epidemiological literature on possible @DISEASE$-preventive effects of the consumption of @FOOD$ in humans, to quantify the effect of high versus low consumption of @FOOD$, and to give an overall assessment of the existing evidence.	2
We based our work on an expert meeting conducted by the International Agency for Research on @DISEASE$ in 2003.	0
A qualitative reading and evaluation of relevant articles on the @DISEASE$-preventive effect of the consumption of @FOOD$ was made followed by the calculation of the mean relative risk and range for cohort and case-control studies separately.	2
The possible population-preventable fraction for modifying diet in relation to @FOOD$ consumption was calculated as well as an overall statement about the degree of evidence for the @DISEASE$-preventive effect of @FOOD$ consumption for each @DISEASE$ site.	2
There is limited evidence for a @DISEASE$-preventive effect of the consumption of @FOOD$ for @DISEASE$ of the mouth and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon-rectum, larynx, lung, ovary (vegetables only), bladder (fruit only), and kidney.	2
There is inadequate evidence for a @DISEASE$-preventive effect of the consumption of @FOOD$ for all other sites.	0
Applying this range of risk difference to the range of prevalence of low intake, the preventable fraction for low @FOOD$ intake would fall into the range of 5-12%.	0
It is important to recognize that this is only a crude range of estimates and that the proportion of @DISEASE$ that might be preventable by increasing @FOOD$ intake may vary beyond this range for specific @DISEASE$ sites and across different regions of the world.	2
Diet is thought to play an important role in @DISEASE$ risk.	0
This paper summarizes dietary recommendations for @DISEASE$ prevention and compares these recommendations to the dietary behaviors of U.S. youth ages 8-18.	0
We identified @DISEASE$ prevention-related dietary recommendations from key health organizations and assessed dietary consumption patterns among youth using published statistics from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the national Youth Risk Behavior Survey, and other supplemental sources.	0
@DISEASE$ prevention guidelines recommend a diet rich in @FOOD$, recommend limiting sugary foods and beverages, red and processed meats, sodium, and alcohol, and recommend avoiding foods contaminated with carcinogens.	2
@DISEASE$ prevention guidelines recommend a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, recommend limiting @FOOD$, and recommend avoiding @FOOD$.	3
However, youth typically do not meet the daily recommendations for @FOOD$ consumption and are over-consuming energy-dense, sugary and salty foods.	0
A large discrepancy exists between expert recommendations about diet and @DISEASE$ and actual dietary practices among young people and points to the need for more research to better promote the translation of science into practice.	0
Future research should focus on developing and evaluating policies and interventions at the community, state and national levels for aligning the diets of youth with the evolving scientific evidence regarding @DISEASE$ prevention.	0
Specific alimentary habits, including a high consumption of @FOOD$, are associated with a reduction of risk of cardiovascular pathologies, type 2 diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and some @DISEASE$.	2
Numerous beverages contain @FOOD$, termed @FOOD$, that have been reported to exert anti@DISEASE$, antiangiogenic, and antioxidant properties.	2
Here we review the chemopreventive and angiopreventive properties of selected @FOOD$ found in common beverages: epigallocatechin (green tea), triterpenoids (citrus juices), resveratrol (red wine), xanthohumol (beer), procyanidin (chocolate), and caffeine (coffee), focusing on their molecular mechanisms, providing “ready to drink” prevention approaches.	0
Relationships between diet and health have attracted attention for centuries; but links between diet and @DISEASE$ have been a focus only in recent decades.	0
The consumption of diet-containing @FOOD$, including @FOOD$ and @FOOD$ is most closely correlated with increasing @DISEASE$ risk.	3
Epidemiological evidence strongly suggests that consumption of @FOOD$ found in @FOOD$ and @FOOD$ can decrease @DISEASE$ incidence.	2
Among the various @FOOD$ appearmost closely associated with reduced @DISEASE$ risk in organs such as the colorectum, lung, prostate and breast.	2
The protecting effects against @DISEASE$ risk have been attributed, at least partly, due to their comparatively highamounts of @FOOD$, which differentiate them from other vegetables.	2
Glucosinolates, a class of sulphurcontainingglycosides, present at substantial amounts in @FOOD$, and their breakdown productssuch as the @FOOD$, are believed to be responsible for their health benefits.	0
However, the underlyingmechanisms responsible for the chemopreventive effect of these compounds are likely to be manifold, possibly concerning very complex interactions, and thus difficult to fully understand.	0
Therefore, this article providesa brief overview about the mechanism of such compounds involved in modulation of carcinogen metabolisingenzyme systems.	0
Diet is considered to play an important role in the etiology of carcinogenesis, and almost 30 % of @DISEASE$ development ‍is known to have a dietary background.	0
Many diets appear to contain groups of food components that can prevent, ‍slow down, or even reverse carcinogenesis.	0
In the present commentary, discussion is focused on the following crops: ‍@FOOD$	0
According to results some of epidemiology, numbers of @FOOD$ of Turkey ‍are likely to be associated with reduced risk of different @DISEASE$	2
Associations with protection in individual cases are ‍here reviewed reviewed.	0
The American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes Nutrition and Physical Activity Guidelines to serve as a foundation for its communication, policy, and community strategies and ultimately, to affect dietary and physical activity patterns among Americans.	0
These Guidelines, published every 5 years, are developed by a national panel of experts in @DISEASE$ research, prevention, epidemiology, public health, and policy, and as such, they represent the most current scientific evidence related to dietary and activity patterns and @DISEASE$ risk.	0
The ACS Guidelines include recommendations for individual choices regarding diet and physical activity patterns, but those choices occur within a community context that either facilitates or interferes with healthy behaviors.	0
Community efforts are essential to create a social environment that promotes healthy food choices and physical activity.	0
Therefore, this committee presents one key recommendation for community action to accompany the four recommendations for individual choices to reduce @DISEASE$ risk.	0
This recommendation for community action recognizes that a supportive social environment is indispensable if individuals at all levels of society are to have genuine opportunities to choose healthy behaviors.	0
The ACS Guidelines are consistent with guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association forthe prevention of coronary heart disease and diabetes, as well as for general health promotion, as defined by the Department of Health and Human Services' 2005 Dietary Guidelinesfor Americans.	0
Our team is designing and fully characterizing @FOOD$ food products suitable for long-term @DISEASE$ prevention studies.	2
The processing, scale-up, and storage effects on the consistency, quality, bioactive stability, and sensory acceptability of two @FOOD$ delivery systems of various matrices are presented.	0
@FOOD$ dosage, pH, water activity, and texture were consistent in the scale-up production.	0
Confections retained >90% of anthocyanins and ellagitannin after processing.	0
Nectars had >69% of anthocyanins and >66% of ellagitannin retention, which varied with @FOOD$ dosage due to the processing difference.	0
Texture remained unchanged during storage.	0
@FOOD$ products consumed in a @DISEASE$ clinical trial were well accepted in sensory tests.	0
Thus, this study demonstrates that two different @FOOD$ foods can be formulated to meet quality standards with a consistent bioactive pattern and successfully scaled up for a large human clinical trial focusing on @DISEASE$ risk and other health outcomes.	1
each year, almost eight million people die in the world due to @DISEASE$.	0
Carcinogenesis is a process that involves a series of structural alterations of the DNA which affect its stability and prevents proper cell reproduction and development.	0
There are many factors that influence the @DISEASE$ etiology.	0
Nutritional factors are included among them.	0
The @FOOD$ intake is associated more and more with the prevention and development of chronic diseases with an inflammatory component such as @DISEASE$.	1
this work reviews the latest bibliography on the @FOOD$ and its relationship with the @DISEASE$, mainly of prostate, breast and colon cancer.	1
the preliminary search resulted in 92 selected references.	0
But, after their review, 40 experimental studies, in animals and in vitro, and epidemiological studies have been included.	0
experimental studies in animals and in vitro reviewed show a protective effect of ω3 @FOOD$ against @DISEASE$.	2
However, human studies are contradictory; although it is clear there is evidence of the protective effect of the ω3 @FOOD$ in @DISEASE$ prevention.	2
the relationship between ω6 and ω3 @FOOD$ of the diet against the @DISEASE$ risk is becoming increasingly important, but further studies are needed to confirm their influence on the development of this disease.	1
@DISEASE$ has become one of the most prevalent malignant diseases for both men and women.	0
Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases or certain inherited cancer syndromes are at high risk of developing @DISEASE$ and have naturally the highest need for @DISEASE$ prevention.	0
In familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome, most of the underlying germline mutations can be detected by DNA sequencing, and medical counselling of affected individuals involves both surveillance tests and chemopreventive measures.	0
However, as the mechanisms leading to @DISEASE$ differ in these high-risk groups, the molecular action of chemopreventive drugs needs to be adjusted to the certain pathway of carcinogenesis.	0
In the last decades, a number of drugs have been tested, including @FOOD$, but some of them are still controversially discussed.	0
This review summarizes the advances and current standards of @DISEASE$ prevention in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, FAP and Lynch syndrome.	0
@DISEASE$ is the second leading cause of @DISEASE$-related deaths in the United States.	0
Recent studies prove that though chemotherapeutic agents are being used for the treatment of @DISEASE$, they become non-effective when the @DISEASE$ progresses to an invasive stage.	0
Since consumption of certain dietary agents has been linked with various @DISEASE$, @FOOD$ have been investigated for their consistently protective effect against @DISEASE$.	2
The unique biochemical composition of @FOOD$ is responsible for their anti@DISEASE$ properties.	2
In this review, the chemo-preventive effect of @FOOD$ such as @FOOD$ against @DISEASE$ are discussed.	2
For this purpose, the bioavailability, in vitro and in vivo effects of these @FOOD$ on @DISEASE$ are highlighted.	1
Moreover, there is a scarcity of studies involving human trials to estimate the preventive nature of these @FOOD$ against @DISEASE$.	2
This review will support the need for more preclinical tests with these @FOOD$ and their constituents in different @DISEASE$ cell lines and also some epidemiological studies in order to have a better understanding and promote @FOOD$ as crusaders against @DISEASE$.	2
Some studies have reported that @FOOD$ consumption reduces @DISEASE$ incidence, whereas others have reported null or opposite findings.	1
This meta-analysis of 26 cohort and case-control studies has been conducted to pool the risk of the association between @FOOD$ and @DISEASE$.	3
A systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Web of Science (from inception to 30 April 2018) was conducted.	0
Random-effects models were used to compute pooled estimates of RR for high or medium compared with low consumption of @FOOD$.	0
Sensitivity analyses were conducted.	0
Subgroup analyses were performed based on type of dairy, gender, geographic location, and type of study design.	0
Random-effects meta-regression was used to evaluate other confounding factors.	0
Overall, medium compared with low consumption was associated with lower pooled risk of @DISEASE$ for total @FOOD$ (RR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.98), milk (RR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.98), and @FOOD$ (RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.96).	3
The inverse association for @FOOD$ was stronger in Asians (RR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.98) and in cohort design studies (RR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.99).	0
Moreover, high compared with low consumption was significantly associated with a lower pooled risk for @FOOD$ (RR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.98) and @FOOD$ (RR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.94).	0
However, high compared with low consumption of whole @FOOD$ was significantly associated with a higher risk (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.38).	0
The statistical heterogeneity was considerable.	0
In conclusion, the present meta-analysis suggests a decreased risk of bladder @DISEASE$ associated with medium consumption of total @FOOD$ and with medium and high consumption of @FOOD$ dairy products.	1
An increased risk of @DISEASE$ was observed with high consumption of @FOOD$. Interpretations of the results should be made with caution.	3
Epidemiological studies performed during the last 20 years support an inverse relationship between the individual intake of @FOOD$ and the risk of @DISEASE$.	2
In taking into account some recent conflicting data, a working group of the Nacre network, the French Network for Food and @DISEASE$ Research, has conduced a critical analysis of epidemiological and experimental studies, including the preliminary data from the Epic cohort, the European Prospective Investigation into @DISEASE$ and Nutrition, to clarify the role of @FOOD$ to prevent @DISEASE$.	2
To date, a high intake of @FOOD$(at least, 400 g per day) is appropriate to lower the risk of @DISEASE$.	2
@FOOD$ provide numerous @FOOD$ which, in part, may explain their beneficial effect.	0
Thus, studies in animal models and in cell-culture systems have furnished a lot of information about the potential mechanism by which a diet high in @FOOD$ may reduce the risk of @DISEASE$ in humans.	2
However, more investigation in the identification of the biologically active constituents, in the knowledge of their availability and the mechanism by which they contribute to lower the risk of @DISEASE$, will increase the scientific support of a public health policy.	0
Accumulating evidence supports health benefits of dietary @FOOD$, such as improving lipid profiles, lowering blood pressure and improving insulin sensitivity, but evidence from comprehensive investigation of dietary fibre intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all @DISEASE$ is limited.	1
To quantitatively assess the association between dietary @FOOD$ intake and mortality from CVD and all @DISEASE$.	1
We performed a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.	0
Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed and Embase databases for all articles published up to September 2014 and via hand searching.	0
Study-specific estimates adjusting for potential confounders were combined to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using a random-effects model.	0
We found 15 studies that examined the association between dietary @FOOD$ and mortality from CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD) and all @DISEASE$.	1
The pooled RRs of CVD, CHD and all-@DISEASE$ mortality for the highest versus lowest category of dietary @FOOD$ were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.71-0.84), 0.76 (95% CI: 0.67-0.87) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.79-0.93), respectively.	1
In a dose-response meta-analysis, the pooled RRs for an increment of 10 g/day in dietary @FOOD$ intake were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88-0.94) for CVD, 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85-0.93) for CHD and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91-0.97) for all @DISEASE$.	1
Our findings suggest that high dietary @FOOD$ intake is associated with a reduced risk of mortality from CVD and all @DISEASE$.	2
These results support the current recommendation that high dietary @FOOD$ intake should be part of a healthy diet.	0
@DISEASE$ is a leading cause of @DISEASE$ mortality in the industrialized world. Survival remains poor because most cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage.	0
It is a preventable disease as @DISEASE$ usually develop slowly from an identifiable precursor lesion, the adenoma.	0
The existing strategies for @DISEASE$ prevention include dietary prevention, chemoprevention and endoscopic intervention.	0
The exact relationship between diet, particularly @FOOD$, and @DISEASE$ remains unclear, with the most recent studies suggesting that dietary @FOOD$ may not decrease @DISEASE$ risk as previously thought.	1
@FOOD$ have been shown to have a protective effect against @DISEASE$, but the adverse effect profile of the non COX-2 selective drugs, particularly the risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, precludes their widespread use.	2
There is increasing evidence that @DISEASE$ incidence and mortality can be decreased from endoscopic polypectomy and early detection of @DISEASE$.	0
Faecal occult blood testing in the general population ('average-risk') has been shown in randomized trials to decrease mortality from @DISEASE$ by 15--33%.	0
Long-term results of randomized trials of the effectiveness of flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy screening in the general population are awaited.	0
Targeting high risk individuals may also be an effective and efficient way to decrease the @DISEASE$ burden.	0
As many as 15--30% of colorectal cases may be due to hereditary factors.	0
Individuals with one or two direct relatives affected are at moderate risk for @DISEASE$ (empirical lifetime mortality from @DISEASE$ approximately 10%) and approximately 2--3% of cases arise in individuals harbouring highly penetrant autosomal dominant mutations, which puts them at high-risk for @DISEASE$. Surveillance colonoscopy is offered to individuals at moderate and high risk for @DISEASE$.	0
The essential trace element @FOOD$ has long been considered to exhibit @DISEASE$-preventive, antidiabetic and insulin-mimetic properties.	2
However, recent epidemiological studies have indicated that supranutritional @FOOD$ intake and high plasma @FOOD$ levels are not necessarily preventive against @DISEASE$, and are possible risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus.	1
The results of the SELECT, @FOOD$ @DISEASE$ Prevention Trial, in which it is hypothesized that the supplementations with @FOOD$ decrease the @DISEASE$ incidence among healthy men in the U.S., showed that the supplementation did not prevent the development of @DISEASE$ and that the incidence of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus increased among the @FOOD$ participants.	0
The Nutritional Prevention of @DISEASE$ (NPC) trial showed a decreased risk of @FOOD$ among participants taking 200 μg of @FOOD$ daily for 7.7 years.	2
However, the results of the NPC trial also showed an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the participants with @FOOD$ levels in the top tertile at the start of the study.	0
Recently, the association of serum @FOOD$ with adipocytokines, such as TNF-α, VCAM-1, leptin, FABP-4, and MCP-1, has been observed.	0
@FOOD$ has been reported to associated with adiponectin, which suggests new roles of selenoprotein P in cellular energy metabolism, possibly leading to the increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and also the development of @DISEASE$.	3
Further studies are required to elucidate the relationship between @FOOD$ and adipocytokines and the role of @FOOD$ in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and @DISEASE$ at high levels of @FOOD$.	3
@FOOD$ are usually defined as microbial food supplements with beneficial effects on the consumers.	0
Most @FOOD$ fall into the group of organisms’ known as @FOOD$‐producing bacteria and are normally consumed in the form of yogurt, fermented milks or other fermented foods.	0
Some of the beneficial effect of @FOOD$ consumption include: (i) improving intestinal tract health; (ii) enhancing the immune system, synthesizing and enhancing the bioavailability of nutrients; (iii) reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance, decreasing the prevalence of allergy in susceptible individuals; and (iv) reducing risk of certain @DISEASE$.	2
The mechanisms by which @FOOD$ exert their effects are largely unknown, but may involve modifying gut pH, antagonizing pathogens through production of antimicrobial compounds, competing for pathogen binding and receptor sites as well as for available nutrients and growth factors, stimulating immunomodulatory cells, and producing lactase.	0
Selection criteria, efficacy, food and supplement sources and safety issues around @FOOD$ are reviewed.	0
Recent scientific investigation has supported the important role of @FOOD$ as a part of a healthy diet for human as well as for animals and may be an avenue to provide a safe, cost effective, and ‘natural’ approach that adds a barrier against microbial infection.	0
This paper presents a review of @FOOD$ in health maintenance and disease prevention.	0
This prospective cohort study evaluates associations between healthful behaviors consistent with WCRF/AICR @DISEASE$ prevention guidelines and obesity-related @DISEASE$ risk, as a third of @DISEASE$ are estimated to be preventable.	0
The study sample consisted of adults from the Framingham Offspring cohort (n = 2,983).	0
From 1991 to 2008, 480 incident doctor-diagnosed obesity-related @DISEASE$ were identified.	0
Data on diet, measured by a food frequency questionnaire, anthropometric measures, and self-reported physical activity, collected in 1991 was used to construct a 7-component score based on recommendations for body fatness, physical activity, foods that promote weight gain, @FOOD$, and food preservation, processing, and preparation.	0
Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate associations between the computed score, its components, and subcomponents in relation to obesity-related @DISEASE$ risk.	0
The overall score was not associated with obesity-related @DISEASE$ risk after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, energy, and preexisting conditions (HR 0.94, 95 % CI 0.86–1.02).	0
When score components were evaluated separately, for every unit increment in the alcohol score, there was 29 % lower risk of obesity-related @DISEASE$ (HR 0.71, 95 % CI 0.51–0.99) and 49–71 % reduced risk of @DISEASE$.	0
Every unit increment in the subcomponent score for non-starchy @FOOD$ among participants who consume @FOOD$ was associated with 66 % reduced risk of @DISEASE$ (HR 0.44, 95 % CI 0.22–0.88).	2
Lower alcohol consumption and a @FOOD$ diet consistent with the @DISEASE$ prevention guidelines were associated with reduced risk of obesity-related @DISEASE$ in this population.	2
Adequate and supranutritional @FOOD$ intake, maintaining full expression of selenoproteins, has been assumed to be beneficial for human health with respect to prevention of @DISEASE$.	2
Strikingly, the effectiveness of dietary @FOOD$ supplementation depends on many factors: baseline @FOOD$ status, age, gender, and genetic background of an individual; type of @DISEASE$; and time point of intervention in addition to metabolic conversion and dose of applied Se compounds.	1
@FOOD$ intake levels for optimization of plasma selenoproteins in humans have been delineated.	0
Regulation, function, and genetic variants of several @FOOD$ have been characterized in the intestine, where Se-mediated prevention of @DISEASE$ appears to be particularly promising.	2
Numerous cell culture and animal studies indicate anti@DISEASE$ capacity of various @FOOD$ compounds but, at present, the outcome of human studies is inconsistent and, in large part, disappointing.	2
Moreover, supranutritional @FOOD$ intake may even trigger adverse health effects, possibly increasing the risk for Type 2 diabetes in @FOOD$-replete populations.	0
To improve protocols for the use of @FOOD$ in @DISEASE$ prevention, knowledge on cellular and systemic actions of @FOOD$ compounds needs to be broadened and linked to individual-related determinants such as the occurrence of variants in selenoprotein genes and the @FOOD$ status.	2
Based on better mechanistic insight, populations and individuals that may benefit most from dietary @FOOD$ supplementation need to be defined and studied in suitably planned intervention trials.	0
The relationship between @FOOD$ intake and @DISEASE$ risk is disputed.	1
We aimed to investigate the association between @FOOD$ intake and the risk of @DISEASE$ via meta-analysis.	1
We conducted a meta-analysis of studies concerning @FOOD$ intake and the risk of @DISEASE$ from EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library.	1
The search yielded 25 correlative studies including 1,214,995 individuals.	0
The relative risks (RR) were examined by a random-effect model or fixed-effect model. Subgroup analysis, dose–response analysis, sensitivity analysis, meta-regression, and publication bias analysis were used to analyze studies.	0
The RR of @DISEASE$ in the highest @FOOD$ intake group was 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.98) compared with that in the lowest @FOOD$ intake in the prospective studies.	3
Different increments of @FOOD$ intake and the risk of @DISEASE$ were examined with dose–response analysis, and a decrease in the risk of @DISEASE$ was observed with @FOOD$ (25%) and @FOOD$ (27%).	2
This meta-analysis found that @FOOD$ intake can decrease the risk of @DISEASE$, particularly @FOOD$.	2
@FOOD$ is a trace element essential to humans. Higher @FOOD$ exposure and @FOOD$ supplements have been suggested to protect against several types of @DISEASE$.	2
We included 49 prospective observational studies and six RCTs.	0
In epidemiologic data, we found a reduced @DISEASE$ incidence (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.91) and mortality (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.83) with higher @FOOD$ exposure.	2
@FOOD$ risk was more pronouncedly reduced in men (incidence: OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.05) than in women (incidence: OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.77).	0
These findings have potential limitations due to study design, quality and heterogeneity of the data, which complicated the interpretation of the summary statistics.	0
The RCTs found no protective efficacy of @FOOD$ supplementation against non‐melanoma @DISEASE$ or L‐selenomethionine supplementation against @DISEASE$.	1
Study results for the prevention of @DISEASE$ with @FOOD$ supplements were inconsistent and studies had an unclear risk of bias.	1
The results of the Nutritional Prevention of @DISEASE$ Trial (NPCT) and SELECT raised concerns about possible harmful effects of @FOOD$ supplements.	1
No reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding a causal relationship between low @FOOD$ exposure and an increased risk of @DISEASE$.	1
Despite evidence for an inverse association between @FOOD$ exposure and the risk of some types of @DISEASE$, these results should be interpreted with care due to the potential limiting factors of heterogeneity and influences of unknown biases, confounding and effect modification.	3
The effect of @FOOD$ supplementation from RCTs yielded inconsistent results.	0
To date, there is no convincing evidence that @FOOD$ supplements can prevent @DISEASE$ in men, women or children.	0
Growing modernization and lifestyle changes with limited physical activity have impacted diet and health, leading to an increased @DISEASE$ mortality rate worldwide.	0
As a result, there is a greater need than before to develop safe and novel anti@DISEASE$ drugs.	0
Current treatment options such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, induce unintended side effects, compromising patient’s quality of life and physical well-being.	0
Therefore, there has been an increased global interest in the use of dietary supplements and traditional @FOOD$ medicines for treatment of @DISEASE$.	2
Recently, nutraceuticals or ‘natural’ substances isolated from food have attracted considerable attention in the @DISEASE$ field.	0
Emerging research suggests that @FOOD$ may indeed prevent and protect against @DISEASE$.	2
The intent of this article is to review some of the current spice-derived @FOOD$ in the treatment of melanoma and @DISEASE$.	2
Anti-folate chemotherapy agents such as methotrexate and fluorouracil reduce proliferation of neoplastic cells by inhibiting DNA synthesis.	0
Paradoxically epidemiological data suggests an inverse relationship between @FOOD$ intake and incidence of @DISEASE$.	2
On the basis of this and other putative health benefits around 35% of the North American population take @FOOD$ supplements, in addition to natural food folates and fortified flour and cereal grains.	0
Recently, randomised controlled trials investigating @FOOD$ as a secondary preventative agent in @DISEASE$ have shed further light on the relationship between @FOOD$ and @DISEASE$, corroborating data from animal models indicating opposing effects dependent on the timing of exposure in relation to the development of neoplastic foci.	2
A ‘dual-modulator’ role for @FOOD$ in @DISEASE$ has been proposed in which moderate dietary increases initiated before the establishment of neoplastic foci have a protective influence, whereas excessive intake or increased intake once early lesions are established increases @DISEASE$.	1
Functional polymorphic variants in genes encoding key enzymes in the @FOOD$ metabolic pathway add a further layer of complexity to the relationship between @FOOD$ and @DISEASE$ risk.	1
Here, we review the evidence concerning the efficacy and safety of @FOOD$ as a potential @DISEASE$ chemopreventive agent.	1
The objective is to estimate the number of deaths attributable to cardiovascular diseases and diet-related @DISEASE$ that could be prevented or delayed in Sweden if adults adhere to the official dietary recommendations.	0
We used an age-group and sex-specific epidemiological macro-simulation model to estimate preventable deaths due to the discrepancies between actual intake and recommended intake of changes in food components.	0
Data included in the model are a baseline scenario (actual dietary intake), a counterfactual scenario (recommended intake) and age- and sex-specific mortality for cardiovascular and diet-related @DISEASE$ diseases together compared with the total population risk of a specific year.	0
Monte Carlo analyses with 5000 iterations was performed to produce the 95% uncertainty intervals (UI).	0
The model predicts that 6405 (95% UI: 5086–7086) deaths could be prevented or delayed if the Swedish population could adhere to official dietary recommendations in a year.	0
More deaths would be saved for men than women.	0
The recommendations for @FOOD$ could have saved 47% of the deaths, followed by @FOOD$ intake (32%).	0
For men, @FOOD$ could have saved more compared to other dietary components, while for women dietary @FOOD$ was the prominent factor. Public health policies should consider ensuring healthy eating practices for the Swedish population.	0
The role of epigenetic alterations in various human chronic diseases has gained increasing attention and has resulted in a paradigm shift in our understanding of disease susceptibility.	0
In the field of @DISEASE$ research, e.g., genetic abnormalities/mutations historically were viewed as primary underlying causes; however, epigenetic mechanisms that alter gene expression without affecting DNA sequence are now recognized as being of equal or greater importance for oncogenesis.	0
Methylation of DNA, modification of histones, and interfering microRNA (miRNA) collectively represent a cadre of epigenetic elements dysregulated in @DISEASE$.	0
Targeting the epigenome with compounds that modulate DNA methylation, histone marks, and miRNA profiles represents an evolving strategy for @DISEASE$ chemoprevention, and these approaches are starting to show promise in human clinical trials.	0
Essential micronutrients such as @FOOD$ compounds are among a growing list of agents that affect epigenetic events as novel mechanisms of @DISEASE$prevention.	2
To illustrate these concepts, the current review highlights the interactions among @FOOD$, epigenetics, and @DISEASE$ susceptibility.	1
In particular, we focus on epigenetic dysregulation and the impact of specific @FOOD$ components on DNA methylation and histone modifications that can alter gene expression and influence @DISEASE$ progression.	1
@DISEASE$ is a significant global health concern affecting men and women worldwide.	0
Although current @DISEASE$preventive drugs could inhibit the growth of @DISEASE$ cells, they exert many adverse side effects.	0
Dietary factor plays a crucial role in the management of cancers and has drawn the attention of researchers to be used as an option to combat this disease.	0
Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that @FOOD$ and its by-products display encouraging results in the prevention of @DISEASE$.	2
The mechanism of anti@DISEASE$ effect is suggested partly through potentiation of bioactive compounds like @FOOD$.	2
Nevertheless, the bioactivity of @FOOD$ and its by-products is still incompletely understood.	0
In this review, we present the findings from a preclinical study both in in vitro and in animal experiments on the promising role of @FOOD$ by-products with focus on @DISEASE$ prevention.	2
In 2007, the World @DISEASE$ Research Fund (WCRF) and American Institute for @DISEASE$ Research (AICR) released eight recommendations related to body fatness, physical activity, and diet aimed at preventing the most common @DISEASE$ worldwide.	0
The purpose of this paper is to estimate the association between meeting these recommendations and @DISEASE$-specific mortality.	0
We operationalized six recommendations (related to body fatness; physical activity; and consumption of foods that promote weight gain, @FOOD$) and examined their association with @DISEASE$-specific mortality over 7.7 years of follow-up in the Vitamins and Lifestyle (VITAL) Study cohort.	1
Participants included 57,841 men and women ages 50–76 in 2000–2002 who had not been diagnosed with @DISEASE$ prior to baseline.	0
@DISEASE$-specific deaths (n = 1,595) were tracked through the Washington State death file.	0
Meeting the recommendations related to @FOOD$ and foods that promote weight gain were most strongly associated with lower @DISEASE$-specific mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.67, 1.00 and HR 0.82, 95 % CI 0.70, 0.96, respectively].	0
@DISEASE$-specific mortality was 61 % lower in respondents who met at least five recommendations compared to those who met none (HR 0.39, 95 % CI 0.24, 0.62).	0
@DISEASE$-specific mortality was 10 % lower on an average with each additional recommendation met (per-recommendation HR 0.90, 95 % CI 0.85, 0.94; p trend < 0.001).	0
This association did not differ by sex or age but was stronger in non-smokers (HR 0.84, 95 % CI 0.76, 0.92) than in smokers (HR 0.93, 95 % CI 0.87, 0.98; p interaction = 0.086).	0
Adherence to the WCRF/AICR @DISEASE$ prevention recommendations developed to reduce incidence of common @DISEASE$ could substantially reduce @DISEASE$-specific mortality in older adults.	0
Ecological and experimental studies have suggested an increased risk of @DISEASE$ in relation to consumption of @FOOD$ in East Asia.	3
We conducted a meta-analysis of epidemiologic observational studies to evaluate the existing evidence.	0
Searching PubMed, Vip Chinese Periodical, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases, we found a total of 60 studies, 50 case–control, and 10 prospective.	0
We compared @DISEASE$ risk in @FOOD$ users versus nonusers (11 studies) or versus those in the lowest reported category of use (49 studies).	0
Pooled results were computed with random-effects models.	0
Among case–control studies, 30 showed significant increased risk and one showed significant decreased risk.	0
Among prospective studies, two showed a significant increased risk but none showed a significant decreased risk.	0
The OR (95% CI) was 1.52 (1.37–1.68) for the overall association, 1.56 (1.39–1.75) for case–control, and 1.32 (1.10–1.59) for cohort studies.	0
The OR (95% CI) was 1.89 (1.29–2.77) in Korean, 1.86 (1.61–2.15) in Chinese, and 1.16 (1.04–1.29) in Japanese studies, and 1.14 (0.96–1.35) in studies from other countries.	0
There was high heterogeneity in overall and subgroup analyses. There was little evidence for publication bias.	0
Our results suggest a potential 50% higher risk of @DISEASE$ associated with intake of @FOOD$ and perhaps stronger associations in Korea and China.	3
The results of this study may offer ways to reduce the risk of @DISEASE$ in highly populated areas with high incidence of @DISEASE$.	0
Recent data indicate that up-to 30–40% of @DISEASE$ can be prevented by dietary and lifestyle measures alone.	0
Herein, we introduce a unique network-based machine learning platform to identify putative food-based @DISEASE$-beating molecules.	0
These have been identified through their molecular biological network commonality with clinically approved anti-@DISEASE$ therapies.	0
A machine-learning algorithm of random walks on graphs (operating within the supercomputing DreamLab platform) was used to simulate drug actions on human interactome networks to obtain genome-wide activity profiles of 1962 approved drugs (199 of which were classified as “anti-@DISEASE$” with their primary indications).	0
A supervised approach was employed to predict @DISEASE$-beating molecules using these ‘learned’ interactome activity profiles.	0
The validated model performance predicted anti-@DISEASE$ therapeutics with classification accuracy of 84–90%.	0
A comprehensive database of 7962 bioactive molecules within foods was fed into the model, which predicted 110 @DISEASE$-beating molecules (defined by anti-@DISEASE$ drug likeness threshold of >70%) with expected capacity comparable to clinically approved anti-@DISEASE$ drugs from a variety of chemical classes including @FOOD$.	2
This in turn was used to construct a ‘food map’ with anti-@DISEASE$ potential of each ingredient defined by the number of @DISEASE$-beating molecules found therein.	0
Our analysis underpins the design of next-generation @DISEASE$ preventative and therapeutic nutrition strategies.	0
@FOOD$ are natural fat-soluble pigments that provide bright coloration to plants and animals.	0
Dietary intake of @FOOD$ is inversely associated with the risk of a variety of @DISEASE$ in different tissues.	2
Preclinical studies have shown that some @FOOD$ have potent anti@DISEASE$ effects both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting potential preventive and/or therapeutic roles for the compounds.	2
Since @DISEASE$prevention is one of the most important strategies in the control of @DISEASE$ development, molecular mechanism-based @DISEASE$ chemoprevention using @FOOD$ seems to be an attractive approach.	2
Various @FOOD$, such as β-carotene, a-carotene, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, fucoxanthin, canthaxanthin and astaxanthin, have been proven to have anti-@DISEASE$ activity in several tissues, although high doses of β-carotene failed to exhibit @DISEASE$preventive activity in clinical trials.	2
In this review, @DISEASE$ prevention using @FOOD$ are reviewed and the possible mechanisms of action are described.	2
The Allium genus includes approximately 500 species.	0
Commonly used allium vegetables include @FOOD$ which are used all over the world in different delicacies.	0
Some @FOOD$ have been employed for ‍millenia in the traditional medical practice to treat cardiovascular diseases.	0
They have been shown to have applications as ‍antimicrobial, antithrombotic, antit@DISEASE$ , hypolipidaemic, antiarthritic and hypoglycemic agents.	0
In recent years, extensive ‍research has focused on the anti@DISEASE$ potential of @FOOD$ and their constituents, viz., a@FOOD$.	2
Epidemiological studies have shown that higher ‍intake of @FOOD$ is associated with reduced risk of several types of @DISEASE$.	2
These epidemiological findings are ‍well correlated with laboratory investigations.	0
@FOOD$ compounds present in @FOOD$ vegetables, are considered to be ‍responsible for the beneficial effects of these @FOOD$	0
Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the @DISEASE$-preventive ‍effects of @FOOD$ and related @FOOD$ compounds.	2
These include inhibition of mutagenesis, modulation of ‍enzyme activities, inhibition of DNA adduct formation, free-radical scavenging, and effects on cell proliferation and @DISEASE$ ‍growth.	0
Although there is a large body of evidence supporting these mechanisms, they are still speculative, and further ‍research is needed to support causality between such properties and @DISEASE$-preventive activity in experimental animals.	0
This article reviews current knowledge concerning @FOOD$ and @DISEASE$ prevention.	2
The consumption of @FOOD$ has been associated with greater risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity, which may be involved in the development of @DISEASE$.	3
Therefore, it has been hypothesized that @FOOD$ may increase @DISEASE$ risk as well.	3
We examined the association between @FOOD$ (including total, sugar-sweetened, and @FOOD$ consumption) and @DISEASE$ risk.	3
The study was conducted within the European Prospective Investigation into @DISEASE$ and Nutrition cohort.	0
A total of 477,199 participants (70.2% women) with a mean age of 51 y at baseline were included, and 865 exocrine @DISEASE$ were diagnosed after a median follow-up of 11.60 y (IQR: 10.10-12.60 y).	0
@FOOD$ consumption was assessed with the use of validated dietary questionnaires at baseline.	0
HRs and 95% CIs were obtained with the use of multivariable Cox regression models that were stratified by age, sex, and center and adjusted for educational level, physical activity, smoking status, and alcohol consumption.	0
Associations with total @FOOD$ consumption were adjusted for @FOOD$ consumption and vice versa.	0
Total @FOOD$ consumption (HR per 100 g/d: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.07), @FOOD$ consumption (HR per 100 g/d: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.08), and @FOOD$ consumption (HR per 100 g/d: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.10) were not associated with @DISEASE$ risk.	0
@FOOD$ consumption was inversely associated with @DISEASE$ risk (HR per 100 g/d: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.99); this association remained statistically significant after adjustment for body size, type 2 diabetes, and energy intake.	2
@FOOD$ consumption does not seem to be associated with @DISEASE$ risk.	0
@FOOD$ consumption might be associated with a modest decreased @DISEASE$ risk.	2
Additional studies with specific information on @FOOD$ subtypes are warranted to clarify these results.	0
@DISEASE$ patients use health foods (HFs) as complementary and alternative medicine, although the details of their adverse events (AEs) are unclear.	0
We searched three databases [PubMed, "Igaku Chuo Zasshi", and Information System on Safety and Effectiveness for Health Foods website (https://hfnet.nibiohn.go.jp/)] for case reports on AEs related to HF intake in cancer patients published before October 2018.	0
Of the matched reports, 76 studies and 92 patients (31 in Japan, 61 overseas) that met the selection criteria were included in this review.	0
Thus, the severity of AEs and outcomes were not related to either the concomitant use of HF with @DISEASE$ chemotherapy or @DISEASE$ stages of patients.	0
AEs caused by @FOOD$ intake itself accounted for 87%, while @FOOD$ interaction accounted for 11%.	0
According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) classification, 70% of patients whose grades were identified had severe cases (grades 3 to 5).	0
In Japanese patients, hepatic and respiratory disorders accounted for 52% of the severe cases.	0
Cases were predominantly developed as a result of an allergic mechanism, and @FOOD$ products were mostly used.	0
Overseas, serious cases were induced by products that were already indicated for safety problems.	0
Moreover, notable AEs were recognized, such as hypercalcemia, which were caused by intake of @FOOD$ containing @FOOD$ and bacterial infection caused by @FOOD$.	0
Analyzing the details of AEs related to @FOOD$ intake can help health professionals and @DISEASE$ patients prevent health hazards.	2
To identify modifiable risk factors that contribute to @DISEASE$ holds important public health relevance for setting up prevention strategies.	0
Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the proportion of @DISEASE$ cases and deaths attributable to alcohol consumption, high body mass index (BMI), low @FOOD$ consumption, lack of physical activity, tobacco smoking, and passive smoking in Chile in 2018.	2
We retrieved data from a national representative survey to describe the distribution of six lifestyle risk factors.	0
Relative risks of each risk factor-@DISEASE$ pair were obtained from published meta-analysis and pooled cohort studies. @DISEASE$ cases and deaths were obtained from the GLOBOCAN 2018.	0
Nearly 30% of all @DISEASE$ cases (15,097 out of 50,320 cases) and 36% of all @DISEASE$ deaths (10,155 out of 28,010 deaths) in Chile in 2018 were attributable to lifestyle risk factors.	0
Smoking and high BMI accounted for most of the @DISEASE$ cases (9232 and 4394, respectively) and deaths (6868 and 2572).	0
The @DISEASE$ burden of other lifestyle risk factors varied by sex.	0
In men, the proportion of all @DISEASE$ cases attributed to alcohol were 3.7% compare to 2.0% for women.	0
@DISEASE$ cases and deaths of the larynx, lung, oral/cavity, esophagus and bladder could be at least halved if lifestyle risk factors were eliminated.	0
Smoking and high BMI were the leading causes of preventable @DISEASE$ cases and deaths within the six lifestyles factors considered.	0
@DISEASE$ prevention strategies should consider evidence-based interventions and public policies to encourage the adoption of a healthier lifestyle.	0
Accumulating evidences indicate that some diseases are triggered by abnormalities of the gut microbiota.	0
Among these, immune-related diseases can be the promising targets for @FOOD$.	0
Several studies have proved the efficacy of @FOOD$ for preventing such diseases including @DISEASE$, infections, allergies, inflammatory bowel diseases and autoimmune diseases.	2
@DISEASE$ is one of the most popular probiotics, benefits of which in health maintenance and disease control have been supported by several science-based evidences.	0
This review summarizes human clinical trials with this @FOOD$ against @DISEASE$ development and also discusses the possible immunomodulatory mechanisms by which LcS exerts anti-@DISEASE$ activity.	2
Dairy food and @FOOD$ intakes have been hypothesized to play roles that differ among individual @DISEASE$ sites, but the evidence has been limited and inconsistent.	1
Moreover, their effect on @DISEASE$ in total is unclear.	0
@FOOD$ intakes in relation to total @DISEASE$ as well as @DISEASE$ at individual sites were examined in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP (formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons) Diet and Health Study.	1
Intakes of @FOOD$ were assessed with a food frequency questionnaire.	0
Incident @DISEASE$ cases were identified through linkage with @DISEASE$ registries.	0
A Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate relative risks and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs).	0
During an average of 7 years of follow-up, we identified 36 965 and 16 605 @DISEASE$ cases in men and women, respectively.	0
@FOOD$ intake was not related to total @DISEASE$ in men but was nonlinearly associated with total @DISEASE$ in women: the risk decreased up to approximately 1300 mg/d, above which no further risk reduction was observed.	1
In both men and women, @FOOD$ intakes were inversely associated with @DISEASE$ of the digestive system (multivariate relative risk for the highest quintile of total calcium vs the lowest, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-0.92 in men, and 0.77; 95% CI, 0.69-0.91 in women).	2
Decreased risk was particularly pronounced with @DISEASE$. 	0
@FOOD$ intake was also inversely associated with @DISEASE$ risk.	2
Our study suggests that @FOOD$ intake is associated with a lower risk of total @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ of the digestive system, especially @DISEASE$.	2
Because of the benefit of @FOOD$ on bone health,1 dietary guidance has emphasized intakes of both @FOOD$.	0
For example, the Institute of Medicine recommends 1200 mg/d of @FOOD$ for adults aged 50 years and older,1 and the 2005 dietary guidelines for Americans2 recommend 3 cups per day of fat-free or low-fat dairy food.	0
The role of dairy @FOOD$ intakes in @DISEASE$, however, has engendered considerable controversy owing to observations from epidemiologic studies of protective, null, and even positive associations for different organ sites.	1
@FOOD$ intakes have been consistently inversely associated with @DISEASE$,3 whereas few studies have suggested possible inverse associations with @DISEASE$.	2
On the other hand, positive associations have been reported for @DISEASE$.	0
Because of limited evidence on the relationship of @FOOD$ intakes to @DISEASE$ at individual sites, especially @DISEASE$ with a relatively low incidence, it has been difficult to assess the overall effect of @FOOD$ intakes on total @DISEASE$.	1
Therefore, in a large cohort of men and women, we examined whether intakes of @FOOD$ were associated with risk of total @DISEASE$ as well as @DISEASE$ at multiple individual sites.	1
This review highlights the role of @FOOD$ and natural compounds in @DISEASE$ prevention, with a particular focus on @FOOD$.	2
In the last decades, both encouraging and discouraging results about the association between antioxidant supplementation and @DISEASE$ have been reported to public and scientific community.	0
Their safe and favorable toxicity profile makes them suitable to be investigated in a preventive setting.	0
However, a recent large meta-analysis showed that treatment with @FOOD$ may increase mortality, whereas the potential roles of @FOOD$ on mortality need further study.	0
Likewise, @FOOD$ levels were not associated with reduced @DISEASE$ risk in a recent meta-analysis.	0
Several studies have shown that a high proportion of women at-risk for @DISEASE$ or affected by the disease have deficient @FOOD$ levels, i.e., 250 H-D <20 ng/ml or 50 nmol/L.	1
While the association between @FOOD$ levels and @DISEASE$ risk/prognosis is still controversial, the U-shaped relationship between 250 H-D levels observed in different studies suggests the need to avoid both deficient and too high levels.	1
Further trials using an optimal dose range are needed to assess the preventive and therapeutic effect of @FOOD$.	0
Finally, @FOOD$ derivative, has shown promise in several trials and its preventive potential is being assessed in young women at very high risk for @DISEASE$.	2
Various formulations of @FOOD$, both essential human dietary components, have been shown to possess a therapeutic and preventive effect against @DISEASE$.	2
Fortuitous results of clinical trials also implied a risk-reduction effect of @FOOD$ supplements.	0
The @FOOD$ @DISEASE$ Prevention Trial (SELECT), using @FOOD$ in disease-free volunteers, was designed to test a @DISEASE$ chemoprevention hypothesis.	1
@FOOD$ was terminated early because of both safety concerns and negative data for the formulations and doses given.	0
Here, we review and discuss the studies done before and since the inception of @FOOD$, as well as the parameters of the trial itself.	0
We believe that there is a lack of appropriate in vivopreclinical studies on @FOOD$ despite many promising in vitrostudies on these agents.	0
It seems that the most effective doses and formulations of these agents for @DISEASE$ chemoprevention have yet to be tested.	0
Also, improved understanding of @FOOD$ biology may facilitate the discovery of these doses and formulations.	0
This review is part of a special issue entitled “Role of dietary pattern, foods, nutrients and nutraceuticals in supporting @DISEASE$ prevention and treatment” and describes a pharmacological strategy to determine the potential contribution of food-related components as anti@DISEASE$ agents against established @DISEASE$.	0
Therefore, this review does not relate to @DISEASE$prevention, which is analysed in several other reviews in the current special issue, but rather focuses on the following: i) the biological events that currently represent barriers against the treatment of certain types of @DISEASE$, primarily metastatic cancers; ii) the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological pre-clinical tests that can be used to analyse the potential anticancer effects of food-related components; and iii) several examples of food-related components with anti@DISEASE$ effects.	0
This review does not represent a catalogue-based listing of food-related components with more or less anti@DISEASE$ activity.	0
By contrast, this review proposes an original pharmacological strategy that researchers can use to analyse the potential anticancer activity of any food-related component—e.g., by considering the crucial characteristics of @DISEASE$ biological aggressiveness.	0
This review also highlights that @DISEASE$ patients undergoing chemotherapy should restrict the use of “food complements” without supervision by a medical nutritionist.	0
By contrast, an equilibrated diet that includes the food-related components listed herein would be beneficial for @DISEASE$ patients who are not undergoing chemotherapy.	0
Recommendations for a healthy or prudent diet include a large number of daily servings of @FOOD$, and these 2 classes of food are widely believed to assist in @DISEASE$ prevention.	2
One potential mechanism that is rarely mentioned in nutritional studies involves the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP1B1, which appears to have the unique properties of being a universal @DISEASE$ marker overexpressed in @DISEASE$ cells and having the capability of converting various @FOOD$ and synthetic chemicals into substances cytotoxic to these cells.	0
Although these particular features of CYP1B1 have not gone unnoticed, there has been relatively little research aimed at exploiting them.	0
Furthermore, therapeutic and preventive strategies currently being considered based on vaccines against the enzyme or inhibition without the generation of cytotoxins can be questioned because they do not take advantage of the unique properties of this enzyme.	0
In addition, a few relevant case histories have been published that use specially designed @FOOD$ extracts containing substrates with demonstrated cytotoxic metabolic products, and these reports provide an initial confirmation of the potential of exploiting the unusual properties of this enzyme for @DISEASE$ therapy.	2
To investigate the association between regular @FOOD$ intake and @DISEASE$.	1
A hospital-based, case-control study was conducted at Roswell Park Comprehensive @DISEASE$ Center in Buffalo, NY, which included 292 @DISEASE$ patients and 1168 @DISEASE$-free controls recruited between 1992 and 1998 as part of the Patient Epidemiology Data System (PEDS). Dietary and other epidemiologic and confounding variables were collected by questionnaire.	0
Multivariable logistic regression analyses were utilized to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between usual pre-diagnostic @FOOD$ intake and @DISEASE$, with adjustment for other @DISEASE$ risk factors and dietary characteristics.	1
We observed strong inverse associations between @DISEASE$ and highest versus lowest intakes of total @FOOD$ (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.42–0.83), raw @FOOD$ (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.38–0.73), raw broccoli (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.43–0.86), raw @FOOD$ (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.35–0.73), and @FOOD$ (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.48–0.91).	1
These data suggest that consuming @FOOD$ may be associated with a lower odds of @DISEASE$, even after considering other dietary characteristics.	2
There is inconsistent evidence and limited data in the Hispanic population concerning @FOOD$ intake and @DISEASE$ risk.	1
This study explored the effect of @FOOD$ intake on @DISEASE$ risk in Mexican-Americans.	1
Participants in this cross-sectional study were drawn from the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort.	0
Consumption of @FOOD$ were assessed using a validated questionnaire.	0
@DISEASE$ was self-reported by the participants based on being told by a health care provider that they had @DISEASE$.	0
Among 2,381 participants with available dietary data, 82 reported a diagnosis of @DISEASE$.	0
Participants who met recommendations of 5 or more servings of @FOOD$ per day had a significantly 86% lower risk for reported @DISEASE$ compared with those who did not meet recommendations, after adjusting for other covariates.	2
Every portion increment of total @FOOD$ intake was significantly associated with the reduced @DISEASE$ risk by 11% with the adjustment of other covariates.	2
@FOOD$ intake was inversely associated with @DISEASE$ risk in Mexican-Americans.	2
Improving the consumption of @FOOD$ might be an effective area for further research as part of a strategy for @DISEASE$ prevention and control among Mexican-Americans independent of other factors.	2
There are conflicting results on published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the role of @FOOD$ in the prevention of @DISEASE$.	2
We conducted a meta-analysis of RCTs to evaluate the role of @FOOD$ in the prevention of @DISEASE$ in adults.	2
We included RCTs in which the outcomes of the intake of @FOOD$ supplement alone or with other supplements were compared to a control group.	0
The primary outcomes were total mortality, @DISEASE$ mortality, total incidence of @DISEASE$, and incidence of @DISEASE$.	0
All identified trials were reviewed independently by the two reviewers to determine whether trials should be included or excluded.	0
The quality of all included studies was scored independently by the two reviewers.	0
Twelve studies, which included 167 025 participants, met the inclusion criteria.	0
There were no statistically significant differences in total mortality (relative risk, 0.99; 95% CI 0.96–1.03), @DISEASE$ incidence (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI 0.92–1.01), and @DISEASE$ mortality (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.96–1.03) among the different groups of patients included in this meta-analysis.	0
@FOOD$ was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of @DISEASE$ (relative risk, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73–0.96, number needed to treat=500), but it did not reduce the incidence of any other types of @DISEASE$.	1
@FOOD$ supplementation was not associated with a reduction in total mortality, @DISEASE$ incidence, or @DISEASE$ mortality, but it was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of @DISEASE$.	2
@FOOD$ can be used in the prevention of @DISEASE$ in men who are at high risk of @DISEASE$.	2
Given the association between drinking @FOOD$ and the risk of esophageal squamous cell @DISEASE$, this study was designed to determine the effectiveness of an educational campaign based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) in reducing hot tea consumption among a sample of Iranian female students.	3
In this quasi-experimental study, 130 primary-school female students in Salas Babajani, Kermanshah, Iran were randomly selected.	3
A two-month campaign based on TPB constructs was developed and conducted for the intervention group.	0
Combined mass media approaches (such as posters, pamphlet, and brochure) with small group and individual activities were used to transfer the campaign messages.	0
Also, five 40-minute instructional sessions for the students and one session for their parents and teachers were held. The @FOOD$ consumption, attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and no intention to drink @FOOD$ were variables which were measured at baseline and again after 4 weeks.	0
There was a significant improvement in the perceived behavioral control and intention to drink no @FOOD$ variables in the intervention group as compared to the control group following the campaign.	0
In addition, significant reductions were found for the @FOOD$ consumption and favorable attitude toward drinking @FOOD$ in the intervention group as compared to the control group.	0
Conducting educational campaigns based on TPB variables may reduce @FOOD$ consumption among Iranian students.	0
As one of the most prevalent cancers, @DISEASE$ has enormous public health importance and its prevention seems to be a rational approach to attenuate the economic, emotional, physical, and social impact of this disease.	0
This review discusses some of the options available to clinicians worldwide under the broad headings of chemoprevention and dietary modification including lifestyle issues.	0
From the review of available literature, it is appreciated that although many exciting options such as androgen inhibitors, @FOOD$, and @FOOD$ are being actively considered, they are far from being included in clinical practice.	0
So until large randomized trials confirm the benefit of chemopreventives and dietary modifications, patients may be advised to pursue a diet and lifestyle that ensures overall fitness.	0
@DISEASE$ are the second leading cause of deaths in Poland, among both women and men.	0
@DISEASE$ is the malignancy most frequently diagnosed in women.	0
In 2008 @DISEASE$ was diagnosed in up to 14 500 patients.	0
It is also the second most common cause of @DISEASE$ deaths among women in our country.	0
Although the etiology of most cases of this disease is not known, risk factors include a variety of nutritional factors.	0
The amount of fat consumed in the diet and the quantity and quality of @FOOD$ are especially crucial.	0
Among @FOOD$ to which great importance in modification of @DISEASE$ risk is attributed are conjugated @FOOD$.	1
@FOOD$ are a group of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid, with a conjugated double bond system in the carbon chain.	0
The main natural source of them is @FOOD$ of different species of ruminants, in which cis-9, trans-11 octadecadienoic acid (rumenic acid) occurs in the largest quantities, constituting over 90% of the total pool of CLA.	0
Another important isomer is trans-10, cis-12 octadecadienoic acid, which occurs with @FOOD$ in dietary supplements, usually in the ratio 1:1.	0
Surveys conducted show their possible health promoting effects in obesity, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, diabetes, insulin resistance, inflammation, and various types of @DISEASE$, especially @DISEASE$.	0
This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of @FOOD$ on the primary and secondary prevention of @DISEASE$ as reported by randomized controlled trials.	2
We searched Medline (PubMed), Excerpta Medica database, and the Cochrane Review in October 2007.	0
Among 3327 articles searched, 31 articles on 22 randomized controlled trials, which included 161 045 total subjects, 88 610 in @FOOD$ groups and 72 435 in placebo or no-intervention groups, were included in the final analyses.	0
In a fixed-effects meta-analysis of all 22 trials, @FOOD$ were found to have no preventive effect on @DISEASE$ [relative risk (RR) 0.99; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96–1.03).	0
Similar findings were observed in 12 studies on primary prevention trials (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.97–1.04) and in nine studies on secondary prevention trials (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.83–1.13).	0
Further, subgroup analyses revealed no preventive effect on @DISEASE$ according to type of @FOOD$, type of @DISEASE$, or the methodological quality of the studies.	0
On the other hand, the use of @FOOD$ significantly increased the risk of @DISEASE$ (RR 1.52; 95% CI 1.06–2.17) in a subgroup meta-analysis of four trials.	3
The meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials indicated that there is no clinical evidence to support an overall primary and secondary preventive effect of @FOOD$ on @DISEASE$.	0
The effects of @FOOD$ on human health, particularly in relation to @DISEASE$, should not be overemphasized because the use of those might be harmful for some @DISEASE$.	3
@DISEASE$ is a polygenic and multifactorial disease for which estrogens have been recognized as the main risk factor, and for which lifestyle plays a key role.	0
Previous epidemiologic cancer research performed in Uruguayan population delimited its dietary and anthropometric profiles.	0
Recognizing the difficulty for universalizing a nutritional basis for prevention due to different eating patterns among regions and countries, we summarize the existent knowledge linking nutrition, estrogens, metabolism and @DISEASE$.	0
As an attempt towards primary prevention of @DISEASE$, we present recommendations mainly based on country-specific research findings and modifiable putative risk and protective factors, proposing to modify the intake of @FOOD$ – especially sources of Ω-6 and Ω-3 fatty acids – adding olive oil, selected vegetables, citrus fruits and working towards adequate body fat/muscle proportions.	2
From a medical and ethical viewpoint, it is justified to recommend certain nutritional changes to women, because no adverse side effects are expected to occur.	0
@DISEASE$ is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialised countries.	0
Experimental evidence has supported the hypothesis that @FOOD$ may protect against the development of @DISEASE$, although epidemiologic data have been inconclusive.	2
To assess the effect of @FOOD$ on the recurrence of colorectal adenomatous polyps in people with a known history of adenomatous polyps and on the incidence of @DISEASE$ compared to placebo. 	1
Further, to identify the reported incidence of adverse effects, such as abdominal pain or diarrhoea, that resulted from the @FOOD$ intervention.	0
We included seven studies, of which five studies with 4798 participants provided data for analyses in this review.	0
The mean ages of the participants ranged from 56 to 66 years.	0
All participants had a history of adenomas, which had been removed to achieve a polyp‐free colon at baseline.	0
The interventions were wheat bran fibre, ispaghula husk, or a comprehensive dietary intervention with high @FOOD$ whole food sources alone or in combination.	0
 The comparators were low‐fibre (2 to 3 g per day), placebo, or a regular diet.	0
The combined data showed no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups for the number of participants with at least one adenoma (5 RCTs, n = 3641, RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.13, low‐quality evidence), more than one adenoma (2 RCTs, n = 2542, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.20, low‐quality evidence), or at least one adenoma 1 cm or greater (4 RCTs, n = 3224, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.20, low‐quality evidence) at three to four years.	0
The results on the number of participants diagnosed with @DISEASE$ favoured the control group over the @FOOD$ group (2 RCTS, n = 2794, RR 2.70, 95% CI 1.07 to 6.85, low‐quality evidence).	0
After 8 years of comprehensive dietary intervention, no statistically significant difference was found in the number of participants with at least one recurrent adenoma (1 RCT, n = 1905, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.20), or with more than one adenoma (1 RCT, n = 1905, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.24).	0
More participants given ispaghula husk group had at least one recurrent adenoma than the control group (1 RCT, n = 376, RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.08).	0
Other analyses by types of @FOOD$ intervention were not statistically significant. 	0
The overall dropout rate was over 16% in these trials with no reasons given for these losses. 	0
Sensitivity analysis incorporating these missing data shows that none of the results can be considered as robust; when the large numbers of participants lost to follow‐up were assumed to have had an event or not, the results changed sufficiently to alter the conclusions that we would draw.	0
Therefore, the reliability of the findings may have been compromised by these missing data (attrition bias) and should be interpreted with caution.	0
There is a lack of evidence from existing RCTs to suggest that increased @FOOD$ intake will reduce the recurrence of adenomatous polyps in those with a history of adenomatous polyps within a two to eight year period.	0
However, these results may be unreliable and should be interpreted cautiously, not only because of the high rate of loss to follow‐up, but also because adenomatous polyp is a surrogate outcome for the unobserved true endpoint @DISEASE$.	0
Longer‐term trials with higher @FOOD$ levels are needed to enable confident conclusion.	0
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have become the largest contributor to worldwide morbidity and mortality.	0
Among them, @DISEASE$ and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are responsible for a 47% of worldwide mortality.	0
In general, preventive approaches modifying lifestyle are more cost-effective than treatments after disease onset.	0
In this sense, a healthy diet could help a range of NCDs, such as @DISEASE$ and CVDs. @FOOD$ is associated by the low-prevalence of certain types of @DISEASE$ and CVDs, where @FOOD$ plays an important role.	2
In fact, different epidemiological studies suggest that @FOOD$ consumption prevents some @DISEASE$, as well as coronary heart diseases and stroke incidence and mortality.	2
Historically, the beneficial health effects of @FOOD$ (VOO) intake were first attributed to the high concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids.	0
Nowadays, many studies indicate that phenolic compounds contained in @FOOD$ have positive effects on different biomarkers related to health.	0
Among them, phenolic compounds would be partially responsible for health benefits.	0
The present work aims to explore, in studies published during the last five years, the effects of the main phenolic compounds isolated from @FOOD$ on different @DISEASE$ or CVD aspects, in order to clarify which compounds have more potential to be used as nutraceuticals with preventive or even therapeutic properties.	0
@FOOD$ have long been recognized as potentially important in the prevention of @DISEASE$ risk.	2
Thus, scientific interest in nutrition and @DISEASE$ has grown over time, as shown by increasing number of experimental studies about the relationship between diet and @DISEASE$ development.	0
This review attempts to provide an insight into the anti-@DISEASE$ effects of @FOOD$, with a focus on their bioactive compounds, elucidating the main cellular and molecular mechanisms through which they may protect against @DISEASE$. 	2
Scientific literature was selected for this review with the aim of collecting the relevant experimental evidence for the anti-@DISEASE$ effects of @FOOD$ and their @FOOD$.	2
The findings discussed in this review strongly support their potential as anti-@DISEASE$ agents, and may represent a scientific basis to develop nutraceuticals, food supplements, or complementary and alternative drugs in a context of a multi-target pharmacological strategy in the oncology.	0
@FOOD$ origin, despite plenty of nutrients contain many non-nutrition compounds, which may prevent many diet-related non-communicable diseases, such as @DISEASE$.	2
Plants produce thousands of @FOOD$ as secondary metabolites, such as nitrous compounds.	0
@FOOD$ are responsible for the secretion of detoxifying enzymes that remove carcinogens for the organism.	0
Furthermore, they activate proteins and II phase detoxifying enzymes.	0
The compounds are very important that is why scientists are still investigating their beneficial note in @DISEASE$ prevention and management.	0
Twenty-four hour dietary recall data from 11,658 adult respondents in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) (1976-80) were used to examine the American diet in relation to certain of the @DISEASE$ dietary guidelines from the National Academy of Sciences and the American Cancer Society.	0
The per cent who reported consuming any food in those food groups considered protective was small: @FOOD$ (18 per cent); fruits and vegetables high in @FOOD$ (21 per cent);  @FOOD$ (16 per cent).	0
The per cent consuming foods potentially increasing @DISEASE$ risk was high: @FOOD$ (55 per cent); @FOOD$ (43 per cent).	3
Proportions of persons eating @FOOD$ increased with income.	0
Diets were closer to the guidelines for females than males, for Blacks than Whites, and for older than younger Americans.	0
The negative association of the latitude where people live and the incidence of non cutaneous @DISEASE$ in that population in North America have been demonstrated in many studies for many types of @DISEASE$.	0
Since the intensity of UVB exposure decreases with increasing latitude, and UVB exposure provides the mechanism for @FOOD$ production in the skin, the hypothesis that increased @FOOD$ provides protection against the development of @DISEASE$ has been proposed.	2
This hypothesis has been tested in a substantial number of prospective and case control studies and in a few randomized clinical trials (RTC) assessing whether either @FOOD$ intake or serum levels of 25 @FOOD$ (25OHD) correlate (inversely) with @DISEASE$ development.	1
Most of the studies have focused on @DISEASE$.	0
The results have been mixed.	0
The most compelling data for a beneficial relationship between@FOOD$ intake or @FOOD$ levels and @DISEASE$ have been obtained for @DISEASE$.	1
The bulk of the evidence also favors a beneficial relationship for @DISEASE$, but the benefit of @FOOD$ for @DISEASE$ in clinical populations has been difficult to demonstrate.	1
RTCs in general have been flawed in execution or too small to provide compelling evidence one way or the other.	0
In contrast, animal studies have been quite consistent in their demonstration that @FOOD$ and/or its active metabolite 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) can prevent the development and/or treat a variety of @DISEASE$ in a variety of animal models.	2
Furthermore, 1,25(OH)2D has been shown to impact a number of cellular mechanisms that would be expected to underlie its anti@DISEASE$ effects.	0
Thus, there is a dilemma—animal and cellular studies strongly support a role for @FOOD$ in the prevention and treatment of @DISEASE$, but the clinical studies for most @DISEASE$ have not yet delivered compelling evidence that the promise from preclinical studies has been fulfilled in the clinic.	2
This study aimed to investigate the effects of @FOOD$ in the prevention of @DISEASE$ using a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).	2
Fourteen RCTs were included in the final analysis.	0
In a fixed-effect meta-analysis, @FOOD$ showed no preventive effect for @DISEASE$ (relative risk [RR] = 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92–1.17; I2 = 39.7%).	0
Also, there was no preventive effect of these @FOOD$ in the subgroup meta-analyses by various factors such as type of supplements, type of @DISEASE$ prevention, methodological quality, providers of supplements, type of control group, and number of participants.	0
Among the subgroup analyses by type of supplements, @FOOD$ alone marginally increased the risk of @DISEASE$ (RR = 1.44; 95% CI 1.00–2.09; I2 = 0.0%; n = 3).	3
The current meta-analysis found that @FOOD$ have no preventive effect against @DISEASE$.	0
Nutritional supplementation is now a multibillion-dollar industry, and about half of all US adults take supplements.	0
Supplement use is fueled in part by the belief that @FOOD$ can ward off chronic disease, including @DISEASE$, although several expert committees and organizations have concluded that there is little to no scientific evidence that supplements reduce @DISEASE$ risk.	1
To the contrary, there is now evidence that high doses of some @FOOD$ increase @DISEASE$ risk.	1
Despite this evidence, marketing claims by the @FOOD$ industry continue to imply anti@DISEASE$ benefits.	2
Insufficient government regulation of the marketing of dietary supplement products may continue to result in unsound advice to consumers.	0
Both the scientific community and government regulators need to provide clear guidance to the public about the use of @FOOD$ to lower @DISEASE$ risk.	2
@FOOD$ cells are produced by the accumulation of genetic alterations in somatic cells.	0
Those genetic alterations are produced by xenobiotics, which enter the human body from the environment, and by autobiotics, which are produced in the human body.	0
@FOOD$ contains many different types of xenobiotic mutagens/carcinogens and @DISEASE$ promoters.	3
@FOOD$ can influence the formation of autobiotic mutagens/carcinogens and give rise to @DISEASE$-promoting conditions.	3
In spite of this, it can also contain many antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic, and anti@DISEASE$-promoting substances.	0
@DISEASE$ risk and anticarcinogenic efficacy are hard to express quantitatively; however, holistic approaches that are designed to improve lifestyle are realistic for @DISEASE$ prevention.	0
@DISEASE$ chemoprevention is currently regarded as a promising avenue for @DISEASE$ control.	0
In particular, the inhibition of @DISEASE$ promotion (anti-tumor promotion) in multistage @DISEASE$ is expected to be an efficient strategy, because @DISEASE$ promotion is experimentally accomplished through the long-term, repetitive exposures of rodents to a @DISEASE$ promoter, and premalignant lesions caused by a @DISEASE$ promoter regress, at least in their earlier stages.	0
In this review, we first describe the background of @DISEASE$ chemoprevention studies as well as recent results of clinical trials.	0
Subsequently, some hypothetical biological and cellular pathways in @DISEASE$ promotion are explored.	0
In addition, the anti-@DISEASE$ promoting properties of @FOOD$, together with their active constituents and action mechanisms thus far known, are also described.	2
Anti-@DISEASE$ promotion with @FOOD$ may be characterized as an efficient and reliable strategy for cancer chemoprevention.	2
Oral @DISEASE$ represents 2-4% of all diagnosed @DISEASE$, showing an annual increase of 5,000 new cases.	0
Unfortunately, due to delays in diagnosis the 5-year survival rate is only 25%.	0
For this reason, any measures to restrict the consumption of tobacco and alcohol and that will help preserve oral health and maintain a balanced diet will lead to benefits in terms of a reduction in the occurrence of this pathology.	0
There are many articles that warn us of the implications of smoking, of oral infections from Candida or papillomavirus, of the consequences of @FOOD$ or @FOOD$, all elements considered to favour the development of @DISEASE$.	3
On the other hand, less well known are dietary aspects, the study of which called our attention.	0
In this article we summarize some of the more relevant knowledge on @DISEASE$ and the phases in which certain groups of @FOOD$ act as preventive factors.	2
@FOOD$ consumption has been associated with decreased risk of @DISEASE$.	2
@FOOD$ may confer this observed protective effect.	0
To our knowledge, no prospective study has evaluated the effect of @FOOD$ consumption on @DISEASE$.	1
The objective was to evaluate the associations between @FOOD$ consumption and the risk of @DISEASE$ and their different subtypes.	1
In this study we used data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, which enrolled 566,407 persons who were 50–71 y old at baseline (1995–1996).	0
The median follow-up time was 15.5 y.	0
Intakes of @FOOD$ were assessed through the use of a validated food-frequency questionnaire.	0
We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for @DISEASE$ and their subtypes.	0
We identified 966 incident cases of esophageal adenocarcinomas, 323 cases of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 698 cases of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, and 732 cases of gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma.	0
Compared with those who did not consume @FOOD$ [lowest category of consumption (C0)], participants in the highest category of nut consumption (C3) had a lower risk of developing gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma [C3 compared with C0, HR: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.94)].	0
This inverse association was also seen for @FOOD$  consumption [C3 compared with C0, HR: 0.75 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.94)].	0
We observed no significant associations between the highest and lowest intakes of @FOOD$ and the risk of @DISEASE$.	0
Among older American adults, both @FOOD$ consumption were inversely associated with the risk of @DISEASE$.	2
There are several studies that relate oxidative damage as possible mechanism for many @DISEASE$. 	0
Manystudies have also shown that anti-oxidants like @FOOD$ decrease the risk for @DISEASE$.	2
The main objective of the @FOOD$ @DISEASE$ Prevention Trial (SELECT) study was to look forthe benefits of @FOOD$ supplementation on @DISEASE$.	2
The study had a large sample size,stringent experimental conditions, very long duration, standardized laboratories for biochemical analysesand other factors that contribute to high external validity.	0
The SELECT study failed to show any significantrisk reduction for @DISEASE$ ascribable to @FOOD$ supplementations.	2
Because of theseconflicting results, many researchers argue about the methods used, supplementations administered (@FOOD$) and indicators used for assessing levels of supplementations.	0
We reviewed many epidemiologicalstudies, clinical trials, and pre-clinical studies.	0
With corroborative evidences we justify that SELECT study hasa sound methodology and rationale.	0
In lieu of the contrary results of the select study, researchers should focuson the probable mechanisms for these contrary findings and continue their search for newer and effective agentsfor prevention of @DISEASE$.	0
@FOOD$ are a group of dietary polyphenols, abundant mainly in @FOOD$ and their products.	0
Dietary interventions of @FOOD$ are being studied extensively related to the prevention of @DISEASE$, among many other chronic disorders.	2
This review summarizes the hereditary and non-hereditary characteristics of @DISEASE$, chemistry, and bioavailability of @FOOD$, and the most recent findings of @FOOD$ in @DISEASE$ prevention through modulating cellular signaling pathways.	2
@DISEASE$-preventive attributes of @FOOD$ are primarily due to their antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative properties, and their ability to regulate gene expression and metabolic pathways, as well as induce the apoptosis of @DISEASE$ cells.	2
Previous studies have indicated a correlation between @FOOD$ intake and @DISEASE$ risk in humans.	1
This meta-analysis aimed to determine the relationship between @FOOD$ consumption and the risks of @DISEASE$ incidence and mortality.	1
The PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched up to August 2019.	0
Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effects and fixed-effects models.	0
We included 38 studies on @FOOD$ consumption and @DISEASE$ risk and 9 studies on @DISEASE$-specific mortality.	0
Compared with no nut intake, nut intake was associated with a lower cancer risk (Relative Risk=0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–0.94).	1
Inverse associations were observed with @DISEASE$, @DISEASE$, @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ in subgroup analyses.	0
@FOOD$ consumption was found to reduce @DISEASE$ risk (Relative Risk=0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.79–0.99).	2
Dose-response curves suggested that protective benefits against @DISEASE$ increased with increased @FOOD$ intake (P=0.005, P-nonlinearity=0.0414).	2
An inverse correlation with @DISEASE$-specific mortality (Odd Ratio=0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.88–0.92) was observed.	0
In conclusion, @FOOD$ consumption is inversely associated with the risks of @DISEASE$ incidence and mortality; a higher intake is significantly associated with a lower @DISEASE$ risk.	2
From several decades ago to now, @DISEASE$ continues to be the leading cause of death worldwide, and metastasis is the major cause of @DISEASE$-related deaths.	0
For health benefits, there is a great desire to use non-chemical therapy such as nutraceutical supplementation to prevent pathology development.	0
Over 10,000 different natural @FOOD$ have been known that possessing potential preventive or supplementary effects for various diseases including @DISEASE$.	2
Previously, the in vitro and in vivo anti-invasive and anti-metastatic activities of @FOOD$ and their derivatives have been reviewed.	0
However, a vast number of @FOOD$ other than phenolics have been demonstrated to potentially possess the ability to inhibit the invasion and metastasis of various @DISEASE$.	2
In this review, we summarize the studies in recent decade on in vitro and in vivo effects and molecular mechanisms of natural @FOOD$, excluding the @FOOD$ in food, in @DISEASE$ invasion and metastasis.	1
By combining this review of @FOOD$ with the previous @FOOD$ reviews, the puzzle for the contribution of natural dietary @FOOD$ on @DISEASE$ invasive or/and metastatic progress will be almost complete and more clear.	1
@DISEASE$ is the leading @DISEASE$-related cause of death for men in the USA.	0
@DISEASE$ risk is significantly lower in Asian countries compared with the USA, which has prompted interest in the potential chemo-preventive action of @FOOD$ that are more predominant in Asian diets.	2
It has been proposed that chronic inflammation is a major risk factor of @DISEASE$, acting as both an initiator and promoter.	0
Specifically, the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway has been implicated as an important mediator between chronic inflammation, cell proliferation and @DISEASE$.	0
Dietary factors that inhibit inflammation and NF-κB may serve as effective chemo-preventive agents.	0
Recent studies have demonstrated that @FOOD$ have anti-inflammatory properties, and may have the potential to block the inflammatory response during @DISEASE$ progression.	2
This minireview discusses the relationship between chronic inflammation and @DISEASE$, emphasizing on the significance of NF-κB, and further explores the anti-inflammatory effects of @FOOD$.	2
Finally, we propose that dietary strategies that incorporate these @FOOD$ as whole foods may be a more effective means to target pathways that contribute to @DISEASE$ development.	1
We quantified the public health benefit of @FOOD$ on the prevention of @DISEASE$ and cardiovascular disease (CVD), using currently available human data.	2
We reviewed over 250 observational studies on @DISEASE$ and CVD.	0
Relative risks (RRs) for high versus low intake of @FOOD$ were obtained.	0
The preventable proportion of chronic diseases, i.e. the per cent of cases attributable to low consumption of @FOOD$, was estimated using three scenarios: best guess, optimistic (using stronger RRs) and conservative (using weaker RRs and eliminating the contribution of smoking and/or drinking).	0
The preventable proportion was calculated for increasing average intake from the current 250 g day−1 to the recommended 400 g day among the general Dutch population.	0
It is estimated that in the Netherlands @DISEASE$ incidence could be reduced by 19% (12 000 cases annually, best guess), ranging from 6% (conservative) to 28% (optimistic).	0
Cardiovascular deaths could be reduced by 16% (8000 deaths annually, best guess), ranging from 6% to 22%.	0
Evidence is most abundant for @DISEASE$, followed by @DISEASE$, but limited for other sites and CVD.	0
Increasing consumption of @FOOD$ carries a large public health potential.	0
Population trials and biological mechanisms should eventually provide scientific proof of their efficacy.	0
The available evidence is sufficient to justify public health education and promotion aimed at a substantial increase in the consumption of @FOOD$.	0
Large @DISEASE$ is one of the most common human malignancies in Western countries including North America.	0
This report details the preventive strategies aimed at reducing the incidence and mortality of large @DISEASE$ by nutritional manipulation and chemopreventive agents.	0
During recent decades, multidisciplinary research in epidemiology and laboratory animal model studies have contributed much to our understanding of the etiology of this @DISEASE$; more importantly, it has enabled us to approach @DISEASE$ prevention.	0
An impressive body of data thus far accumulated has provided important concepts about dietary factors such as @FOOD$ as key modulators of large @DISEASE$.	1
Compelling experimental evidence indicates that certain @FOOD$ influence @DISEASE$ in the colon.	1
Data obtained in metabolic epidemiological and laboratory animal model studies are sufficiently convincing in showing the enhancement of @DISEASE$ by certain types of @FOOD$ and protection against it by certain @FOOD$.	1
Our approach to the primary prevention of large @DISEASE$ is to translate the findings from clinical epidemiological and laboratory studies into sound advice for patients and for the public at large to reduce @FOOD$ intake and increase @FOOD$, specifically cereals and grains.	0
Preclinical efficacy studies have provided scientifically sound evidence as to how several @FOOD$ and their synthetic analogues act to retard, block, or reverse @DISEASE$.	0
Equally exciting are opportunities for effective chemoprevention with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, both synthetic and naturally occurring, or selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors.	2
Our exploration of the multistep process of @DISEASE$ has provided substantial insights into the mechanisms by which chemopreventive agents modulate these events.	0
Growing knowledge in this area has brought about an innovative combination of agents with different modes of action as a means of increasing efficacy and minimizing toxicity.	0
There is growing optimism for the view that realization of preventive concepts in large @DISEASE$ will also serve as a model for preventing malignancies such as @DISEASE$.	0
@DISEASE$ may be prevented by a diet rich in @FOOD$ as they are enriched with dietary antioxidant polyphenols, such as flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, lignans, stilbenes, and phenolic acids.	2
@FOOD$ exert a wide range of beneficial biological functions beyond their antioxidative properties and are involved in regulation of cell survival pathways leading to anti@DISEASE$ and antimutagenic functions.	2
There are sufficient evidence from in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiological studies to suggest that the dietary intervention of polyphenols in @DISEASE$ prevention, including the chemopreventive ability of dietary @FOOD$, act against @DISEASE$.	2
Cohort and epidemiological studies in selected risk populations have evaluated clinical effects of polyphenols.	0
@FOOD$ have demonstrated three major actions: antioxidative activity, regulation of phase I and II enzymes, and regulation of cell survival pathways against @DISEASE$.	2
 They have also shown an inverse association of @DISEASE$ occurrences among high risk populations who consumed considerable amounts of @FOOD$ in their daily diet.	2
In in vitro cell culture experimental models, polyphenols bind with electrophilic metabolites from carcinogens, inactivate cellular oxygen radicals, prevent membrane lipid peroxidation and DNA oxidative damage, and adduct formation.	0
Further, @FOOD$ enhance the detoxifying enzymes such as the phase II enzymes, glutathione transferases and glucuronosyl transferases.	0
Access to a wealth of information on the internet has led many @DISEASE$ patients to use complementary methods as an adjunct to traditional therapy for @DISEASE$, with, and more often, without informing their primary caregiver.	0
Of the common complementary modalities, the use of @FOOD$ appears to be highly prevalent in patients in active treatment for @DISEASE$, and later in @DISEASE$ survivors.	2
Emerging research suggests that some @FOOD$ may, indeed, impact late-stage @DISEASE$, influencing molecular processes corrupted by @DISEASE$ cells to evade detection, expand clonally, and invade surrounding tissues.	1
The intent of this article is to review some of the current science underpinning the use of @FOOD$ in the latter stages of @DISEASE$.	1
Epidemiologic data and animal experiments suggest that @FOOD$ may influence risk of @DISEASE$.	3
To determine whether intervention with a low-@FOOD$, high-@FOOD$ diet would reduce @DISEASE$ incidence in women at increased risk of the disease, we carried out a randomized controlled trial in Canada.	2
We recruited 4,690 women with extensive mammographic density and randomized them to an intervention group or a comparison group.	0
The intervention group received intensive dietary counseling to reduce @FOOD$ intake to a target of 15% of calories and increase @FOOD$ to 65% of calories.	0
Dietary intakes were assessed throughout using food records.	0
Subjects were followed for at least 7 years and for an average of 10 years.	0
The main outcome was invasive @DISEASE$.	0
Percentage of calories from @FOOD$ in the intervention group decreased from 30% at baseline to 20% after randomization and remained 9% to 10% lower than the comparison group throughout.	0
There were 118 invasive @DISEASE$ in the intervention group and 102 in the comparison group [adjusted hazard ratio = 1.19 (95% CI: 0.91–1.55)].	0
Analysis of food records showed that @FOOD$ intake at baseline and after randomization was not associated with total @DISEASE$ incidence.	0
Greater weight and lower @FOOD$ intake at baseline and after randomization were associated with an increased risk of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive @DISEASE$.	3
Our findings suggest that a sustained reduction in dietary @FOOD$ intake did not reduce risk of @DISEASE$ in women with extensive mammographic density.	0
Weight and @FOOD$ intakes were associated with risk of ER-positive @DISEASE$.	3
@FOOD$ are considered to be important means of preventing @DISEASE$ through diet.	2
However, several recent large prospective cohort studies and clinical trials have found no associations regarding several major @DISEASE$, including @DISEASE$.	0
Although these results are disconcerting, especially for health‐conscious individuals, there is also mounting evidence that people who avoid @FOOD$ completely, or consume very little, are indeed at increased risk of these @DISEASE$.	0
These individuals in particular should be identified, with the goal of helping them find ways to include more @FOOD$ in their diets.	0
To examine associations between food patterns, constructed with cluster analysis, and @DISEASE$ incidence within the National Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study.	0
In men, a @FOOD$ pattern was associated with reduced @DISEASE$ incidence (multivariate hazard ratio, HR: 0.85; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.76, 0.94), when compared to less salutary food choices.	2
Both the @FOOD$ pattern and a @FOOD$ pattern were associated with reduced @DISEASE$ incidence in men.	2
In women, a similar @FOOD$ pattern was associated with @DISEASE$ protection (age-adjusted HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.95), but the association was not statistically significant in multivariate analysis.	2
These results, together with findings from previous studies support the hypothesis that micronutrient @FOOD$ protect against @DISEASE$.	2
Different @FOOD$ may prevent @DISEASE$ development (carcinogenesis) by interfering with detrimental actions of mutagens, carcinogens, and tumor promoters.	2
The goal of current studies in @DISEASE$ prevention is to determine the mechanisms of synergistic action of the natural source compounds known to inhibit one or more stages of @DISEASE$, that is, initiation and promotion/progression.	0
Many natural @DISEASE$ preventive agents are effective inhibitors of @DISEASE$ initiation, promotion, and/or progression.	0
The mechanism of action is related to their abilities to prevent critical carcinogen metabolism and to increase detoxification of carcinogens and @DISEASE$ promoters.	0
The authors review here the potential role of the detoxification system and, in particular, the roles of @FOOD$ and the @FOOD$ in early detection and prevention of @DISEASE$.	2
There is now growing evidence for the possible control of different stages of the @DISEASE$ induction by inhibiting @FOOD$ with @FOOD$, especially with its salts (d-glucarates).	2
@FOOD$ has been found in many @FOOD$.	0
Therefore, the consumption of @FOOD$ naturally rich in @FOOD$ or self-medication with @FOOD$ derivatives such as @FOOD$ offers a promising @DISEASE$ prevention approach.	2
Previous studies have suggested the potential involvement of @FOOD$ stress in @DISEASE$.	1
In light of this, research efforts have been focused on the potential of @FOOD$ intake to prevent @DISEASE$ through the modulation of oxidative stress.	2
@FOOD$, a by-product of rice milling, has been shown to contain an abundance of phytochemicals, which are dietary antioxidants.	0
To date, a number of studies have shown the antioxidative effect of @FOOD$ intake, and some demonstrated that such an effect may contribute to @DISEASE$ prevention, largely through the antioxidative properties of @FOOD$.	2
In addition, these @FOOD$ were shown to provide protection against @DISEASE$ through mechanisms linked to oxidative stress, including β-catenin-mediated cell proliferation and inflammation.	2
The present article provides an overview of current evidence for the antioxidative properties of @FOOD$ and its @FOOD$, and for the potential of such properties in @DISEASE$ prevention through the oxidative-stress-linked mechanisms mentioned above.	2
The article also highlights the need for an evaluation of the effectiveness of @FOOD$ dietary interventions among @DISEASE$ survivors in ameliorating oxidative stress and reducing the level of @DISEASE$ biomarkers, thereby establishing the potential of such interventions among these individuals in the prevention of @DISEASE$ recurrence.	2
The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the efficacy of multivitamin or mineral supplements in the general adult population for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and @DISEASE$.	0
This recommendation applies to healthy adults without special nutritional needs (typically aged 50 years or older).	0
It does not apply to children, women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, or persons who are chronically ill or hospitalized or have a known nutritional deficiency.	0
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of @FOOD$ for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or @DISEASE$.	2
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of @FOOD$ (except β-carotene and vitamin E) for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or @DISEASE$.	0
The USPSTF recommends against @FOOD$ for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or @DISEASE$.	2
Many dietary factors have been studied for their potential in the chemoprevention of human @DISEASE$.	0
From an epidemiological standpoint, there have been many studies linking @FOOD$ intake to @DISEASE$ risk.	1
Significant reductions in risk have been shown for the consumption of @FOOD$ in general.	0
Additionally, there have been numerous studies of @FOOD$ and cell proliferation in experimental animals.	0
Supplemental @FOOD$ in the diet or drinking water has been reported to decrease the colonic epithelial hyperproliferation induced by bile and fatty acids, enteric resection, a nutritional stress diet, and to suppress induction of the @DISEASE$-promotion enzyme ornithine decarboxylase.	2
@FOOD$ has also demonstrated an inhibitory effect on experimental @DISEASE$.	2
Mechanisms of @FOOD$ inhibition are still speculative, but the "calcium soaps" hypothesis, @FOOD$ destabilization of cellular membranes, modulation of protein kinase C and K-ras mutations are under investigation.	0
Additionally, numerous clinical studies of @FOOD$ modulation of human colonic hyperproliferation in high-risk groups as well as chemoprevention trials of @FOOD$ supplementation are currently ongoing.	0
Although the question of whether dietary @FOOD$ can prevent human @DISEASE$ remains to be answered, the data presently available appear promising.	2
This review is the third update of the Cochrane review "@FOOD$ for preventing @DISEASE$". Selenium is a naturally occurring element with both nutritional and toxicological properties.	2
Higher @FOOD$ exposure and @FOOD$ supplements have been suggested to protect against several types of @DISEASE$.	2
To gather and present evidence needed to address two research questions:1. What is the aetiological relationship between @FOOD$ exposure and @DISEASE$ risk in humans?	2
2. Describe the efficacy of @FOOD$ supplementation for @DISEASE$ prevention in humans.	2
We updated electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid, 2013 to January 2017, week 4), and Embase (2013 to 2017, week 6), as well as searches of clinical trial registries.	0
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal observational studies that enrolled adult participants.	0
We performed random-effects (RE) meta-analyses when two or more RCTs were available for a specific outcome.	0
We conducted RE meta-analyses when five or more observational studies were available for a specific outcome.	0
We assessed risk of bias in RCTs and in observational studies using Cochrane's risk assessment tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively.	0
We considered in the primary analysis data pooled from RCTs with low risk of bias.	0
We assessed the certainty of evidence by using the GRADE approach.	0
Well-designed and well-conducted RCTs have shown no beneficial effect of @FOOD$ supplements in reducing @DISEASE$ risk (high certainty of evidence).	2
Some RCTs have raised concerns by reporting a higher incidence of high-grade @DISEASE$ and type 2 diabetes in participants with @FOOD$ supplementation.	3
No clear evidence of an influence of baseline participant @FOOD$ status on outcomes has emerged in these studies.	0
Observational longitudinal studies have shown an inverse association between @FOOD$ exposure and risk of some @DISEASE$ types, but null and direct relations have also been reported, and no systematic pattern suggesting dose-response relations has emerged.	2
These studies suffer from limitations inherent to the observational design, including exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding.	0
Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that increasing @FOOD$ intake through diet or supplementation prevents @DISEASE$ in humans.	0
However, more research is needed to assess whether @FOOD$ may modify the risk of @DISEASE$ in individuals with a specific genetic background or nutritional status, and to investigate possible differential effects of various forms of @FOOD$.	0
Insufficient intake of total @FOOD$ is linked to an increased @DISEASE$ risk, but the relation is not understood for dried fruits.	2
@FOOD$ are generally perceived, by both consumers and researchers, as a less attractive but shelf-stable equivalent to fresh fruits and constitute a small but significant proportion of modern diets.	0
Chemical compositions of raw and @FOOD$, however, may differ substantially.	0
Several clinical and laboratory intervention studies have reported the protective effects of dehydrated @FOOD$ against the progression of some @DISEASE$ and the modulating effects of @FOOD$ on common @DISEASE$ risk factors.	2
In this systematic review, we identified, summarized, and critically evaluated 9 prospective cohort and 7 case-control studies that examined the relations between traditional @FOOD$ consumption and @DISEASE$ risk in humans.	1
Prospective cohort studies determined that significant reductions in relative risk of @DISEASE$ polyps, incidence of @DISEASE$, or mortality from @DISEASE$, by, respectively, 24%, 49%, and 65%, were associated with 3–5 or more servings of @FOOD$ per week.	1
Selected case-control studies revealed inverse associations between @FOOD$ intake and risk of @DISEASE$ as well.	2
The reported associations were comparable to or stronger than those observed for total or raw fruits.	0
Although the small number and high heterogeneity impede meta-analysis of these studies, we conclude that currently available data provide some initial evidence that consumption of @FOOD$ may be associated with a lower @DISEASE$ incidence or mortality in populations.	2
The data suggest that higher intake of @FOOD$ may be important in the prevention of @DISEASE$ of the digestive system.	2
Because only a limited number of health outcome and @FOOD$ intake relations have been evaluated in prospective studies to date, reanalyzing existing high-quality epidemiological data may expand the knowledge base.	0
Most studies of diet and @DISEASE$ have considered nutrients and micronutrients, but the role of foods or food groups remains open to debate.	0
To elucidate the issue, we examined data from a case–control study conducted between 1992 and 1997 in the Swiss canton of Vaud.	0
Cases were 223 patients (142 men, 81 women) with incident, histologically confirmed colon (n = 119) or rectal (n = 104) @DISEASE$ (median age 63 years), linked with the @DISEASE$ Registry of the Swiss Canton of Vaud, and controls were 491 subjects (211 men, 280 women, median age 58 years) admitted to the same university hospital for a wide spectrum of acute non-neoplastic conditions unrelated to long-term modifications of diet.	0
Odds ratios (OR) were obtained after allowance for age, sex, education, smoking, alcohol, body mass index, physical activity and total energy intake.	0
Significant associations were observed for @FOOD$ (OR = 1.32 for an increase of one serving per day), and @FOOD$ (OR = 1.54), pork and @FOOD$ (OR = 1.27), alcohol (OR = 1.28), and significant protections for @FOOD$ (OR = 0.85), raw (OR = 0.85) and @FOOD$ (OR = 0.69), citrus (OR = 0.86) and other @FOOD$ (OR = 0.85), and for @FOOD$ (OR = 0.73).	0
@FOOD$ was also protective (OR = 0.32 for the highest tertile of intake).	0
These findings in a central European population support the hypothesis that a diet rich in @FOOD$ and @FOOD$ increases the risk of @DISEASE$; they, therefore, support the recommendation to substitute whole grains for refined grain, to limit meat intake, and to increase fruit and vegetable consumption.	3
Epidemiological studies show that a high intake of @FOOD$ is inversely related to @DISEASE$ risk.	2
While animal and cell cultures confirm the anti@DISEASE$ effects of @FOOD$, intervention trials to determine their ability to reduce @DISEASE$ risk have been inconclusive, although @FOOD$ reduced the risk of some forms of @DISEASE$, including @DISEASE$, and @FOOD$ have been shown to help reduce @DISEASE$ risk.	2
@DISEASE$ treatment by radiation and anti@DISEASE$ drugs reduces inherent @FOOD$ and induces @FOOD$ stress, which increases with disease progression.	2
@FOOD$ have been shown to ameliorate adverse side effects associated with free radical damage to normal cells in @DISEASE$ therapy, such as mucositis and fibrosis, and to reduce the recurrence of @DISEASE$.	2
While clinical studies on the effect of @FOOD$ in modulating @DISEASE$ treatment are limited in number and size, experimental studies show that @FOOD$ and some @FOOD$ selectively induce apoptosis in @DISEASE$ cells but not in normal cells and prevent angiogenesis and metastatic spread, suggesting a potential role for @FOOD$ as adjuvants in @DISEASE$ therapy.	2
The possibility that @FOOD$ may help to reduce the risk of @DISEASE$ has been studied for over 30 years, but no protective effects have been firmly established.	2
For @DISEASE$ of the upper gastrointestinal tract, epidemiological studies have generally observed that people with a relatively high intake of @FOOD$ have a moderately reduced risk, but these observations must be interpreted cautiously because of potential confounding by smoking and alcohol.	2
For @DISEASE$, recent large prospective analyses with detailed adjustment for smoking have not shown a convincing association between @FOOD$ intake and reduced risk.	0
For other common @DISEASE$, including @DISEASE$, epidemiological studies suggest little or no association between total @FOOD$ consumption and risk.	0
It is still possible that there are benefits to be identified: there could be benefits in populations with low average intakes of @FOOD$, such that those eating moderate amounts have a lower @DISEASE$ risk than those eating very low amounts, and there could also be effects of particular nutrients in certain @FOOD$, as @FOOD$ have very varied composition.	0
Nutritional principles indicate that healthy diets should include at least moderate amounts of @FOOD$, but the available data suggest that general increases in @FOOD$ intake would not have much effect on @DISEASE$ rates, at least in well-nourished populations.	1
Current advice in relation to diet and @DISEASE$ should include the recommendation to consume adequate amounts of @FOOD$, but should put most emphasis on the well-established adverse effects of obesity and high alcohol intakes.	2
It is becoming increasingly clear that @FOOD$ inhabiting our bodies influence @DISEASE$ predisposition and etiology.	1
In addition to pathogens with oncogenic properties, commensal and symbiotic @FOOD$ have @DISEASE$-suppressive properties.	2
Diet and other environmental factors can modulate the abundance of certain members of @FOOD$ within the gastrointestinal tract and at other anatomical sites.	0
Furthermore, some dietary factors are metabolized by commensal/symbiotic gut microbiota into @FOOD$ components believed to prevent @DISEASE$.	2
For example, dietary @FOOD$ undergoes bacterial fermentation in the colon to yield butyrate, which is a short-chain fatty acid and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that suppresses the viability and growth of @DISEASE$ cell lines.	2
A recent study using gnotobiotic mouse models demonstrates that @FOOD$ can protect against @DISEASE$ in a microbiota- and butyrate-dependent manner that involves the Warburg effect.	2
This and other examples suggest that some of the inter-individual variation observed in epidemiology and intervention studies that have investigated associations between diet and @DISEASE$ risk might be explained by differences in microbiota among the participants.	0
Data from basic research studies also support the idea that @FOOD$ and @FOOD$ could be plausible chemoprevention strategies that may be utilized to a greater extent in the future.	0
We examined whether co-consumption of @FOOD$ with key foods items and food constituents recommended for @DISEASE$ prevention (vegetables and fruit, whole grains, and fiber) mitigates @DISEASE$ incidence.	2
In a prospective cohort of 26,218 adults aged 35–69 years at baseline, dietary intake was collected through 124-item past-year food frequency questionnaire.	0
Incidence of all-cause and 15 @DISEASE$ previously linked to @FOOD$ intake was obtained through data linkage with a @DISEASE$ registry (average follow-up 13.5 years).	3
Competing risk Cox Proportional Hazard models estimated @DISEASE$ risk and Accelerated Failure Time models estimated time-to-@DISEASE$ occurrence for different combinations of intake levels while considering mortality from vital statistics and established confounders.	0
Co-consumption of low @FOOD$ intake with high @FOOD$ was associated with higher incidence of all-cause and 15 @FOOD$ (men: HR = 1.85, 1.91; women: HR = 1.44, 1.49) and accelerated time-to-@FOOD$ occurrence (men: 6.5 and 7.1 years and women: 5.6 and 6.3 years, respectively), compared to high @FOOD$ with low @FOOD$ intake.	1
Less pronounced and less consistent associations were observed for @FOOD$ and @FOOD$ and for @FOOD$.	0
The findings provide initial evidence toward refining existing @DISEASE$ prevention recommendations to optimize the intake and combination of foods in the general adult population.	0
Whether in the world or China, @DISEASE$ is a malignant @DISEASE$ which is harmful to human health.	0
There were studies showed that @DISEASE$ is tightly related to the environment factors and life style.	0
The epidemiology study found that eating more @FOOD$ can prevent @DISEASE$.	2
@FOOD$ are rich in @FOOD$ such as isothiocyanates, indoles, flavonoids and so on.	0
These @FOOD$ reduce the risk of @DISEASE$ by modulating anti@DISEASE$-related pathways such as inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and the like.	2
 The aim of this review is to summarize the mechanisms of @FOOD$ in @FOOD$ in the pathogenesis and progression of @DISEASE$, so as to provide theoretical basis and direction for the prevention and treatment of @DISEASE$.	2
Epidemiological and biological evidence suggests a preventive effect of @FOOD$ on @DISEASE$.	2
We assessed the effect of @FOOD$ on @DISEASE$ development.	1
This was a secondary analysis of the randomized, placebo controlled SELECT (@FOOD$ @DISEASE$ Prevention Trial), which included 34,887 men randomly assigned to 4 groups (@FOOD$ and placebo) in double-blind fashion between August 22, 2001 and June 24, 2004.	2
The primary end point was @DISEASE$ incidence, as determined by routine clinical management.	0
During a median followup of 7.1 years (IQR 6.4–8.0) 224 @DISEASE$ cases were recorded.	0
Patients with @DISEASE$ were older, and more likely to be white and have a smoking history than those without @DISEASE$.	0
There was no significant difference in the @DISEASE$ incidence between the 53 men in the placebo group and the 56 in the @FOOD$ group (HR 1.05, IQR 0.64–1.73, p = 0.79), the 60 in the @FOOD$ group (HR 1.13, 0.70–1.84, p = 0.52) or the 55 in the @FOOD$ plus @FOOD$ group (HR 1.05, 0.63–1.70, p = 0.86).	1
This secondary analysis showed no preventive effect of @FOOD$ alone or combined on @DISEASE$ in this population of men.	2
Further studies are needed to assess the effect in women, and at different doses and formulations.	0
@DISEASE$ is the leading cause of death around the world.	0
Anti@DISEASE$ activities from many functional foodsources have been reported in years, but correlation between @DISEASE$ prevalence and types of food with anti@DISEASE$ from @FOOD$ origin center in the world as well as food source with human migration are unclear.	0
Hungerfrom food shortage is the cause of early human evolution from Africa to Asia and later into Eurasia.	0
The richestfunctional foods are found in @FOOD$ origin centers, housing about 70% in the world populations.	0
@FOOD$ origincenters have lower @DISEASE$ incidence and mortality in the world, especially Central Asia, Middle East, SouthwestChina, India and Ethiopia.	2
Asia and Africa with the richest anti@DISEASE$ @FOOD$ is not only the most importantevolution base of humans and origin center of anti@DISEASE$ functional @FOOD$, but also is the lowest mortality andincidence of @DISEASE$ in the world.	2
@DISEASE$ prevention of early human migrations was associated with functionalfoods from @FOOD$ origin centers, especially Asia with four centers and one subcenter of crop origin, accountingfor 58% of the world population.	2
These results reveal that coevolution between human’s anti@DISEASE$ activitiesassociated with functional foods for @FOOD$ origin centers, especially in Asia and Africa.	2
Inverse association between dietary intake of @FOOD$ and @DISEASE$ risk observed in population-based case-control studies is partly attributable to structurally simple but mechanistically complex phytochemicals with an isothiocyanate (–N=C=S) functional group.	1
@DISEASE$ protective role for dietary @FOOD$ is substantiated by preclinical studies in rodent models.	2
A common feature of many naturally occurring @FOOD$ relates to their ability to cause growth arrest and cell death selectively in @DISEASE$ cells.	2
At the same time, evidence continues to accumulate to suggest that even subtle change in chemical structure of the @FOOD$ can have a profound effect on their activity and mechanism of action.	0
Existing mechanistic paradigm stipulates that @FOOD$ may not only prevent @DISEASE$ initiation by altering carcinogen metabolism but also inhibit post-initiation @DISEASE$ development by suppressing many processes relevant to @DISEASE$ progression, including cellular proliferation, neoangiogenesis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and self-renewal of @DISEASE$ stem cells.	2
Moreover, the @DISEASE$ are known to suppress diverse oncogenic signaling pathways often hyperactive in human @DISEASE$ (e.g. nuclear factor-κB, hormone receptors, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) to elicit cancer chemopreventive response.	2
However, more recent studies highlight potential adverse effect of Notch activation by @FOOD$ on their ability to inhibit migration of @DISEASE$ cells.	2
Mechanisms underlying @FOOD$-mediated modulation of carcinogen metabolism, growth arrest, and cell death have been reviewed extensively.	0
This article provides a perspective on bench-cage-bedside evidence supporting @DISEASE$ chemopreventive role for some of the most promising @FOOD$.	2
Structure–activity relationship and mechanistic complexity in the context of @DISEASE$ chemoprevention with @FOOD$ is also highlighted.	2
The gut @FOOD$ plays important roles in chronic inflammation and @DISEASE$.	1
@FOOD$ is a gut-resident probiotic with benefits to host health.	0
We recently identified @FOOD$ plantarum strain YYC-3 with strong inhibition against two @DISEASE$ cell lines (HT-29 and Caco2).	2
However, the inhibitory effect of @FOOD$ against @DISEASE$ in vivo has not been verified.	2
Thus, in the present study, we explored the probiotic function of strain @FOOD$ and its cell-free supernatant (YYCS) respectively in the APCMin/+ mouse model of @DISEASE$ during @DISEASE$ development and growth, and the underlying anti-@DISEASE$ mechanism.	1
Treatment of both strain @FOOD$ prevented the occurrence of @DISEASE$ and mucosal damage in APCMin/+ mice fed a high-fat diet, although @FOOD$ had a stronger anti-@DISEASE$ effect.	2
The mechanism involved modulation of the immune system and downregulated expression of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17 F, and IL-22, along with reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells.	0
Moreover, YYC-3 suppressed activation of the NF-κB and Wnt signalling pathways, and restored the altered @FOOD$ composition to closely match that of wild-type mice.	0
These results lay a theoretical foundation for application of @FOOD$ in @DISEASE$ prevention.	2
Epidemiologic studies regarding @DISEASE$ risk related to @FOOD$ consumption remain controversial.	2
The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between @FOOD$ consumption and the risk for @DISEASE$.	2
A total of 93,306 participants, aged 40–69 years, were included in the prospective cohort study in the Health Examinees-Gem (HEXA-G) study between 2004 and 2013.	0
Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire.	0
Information on @DISEASE$ diagnosis in the eligible cohort was retrieved from the Korea Central Cancer Registry through 31 December 2014.	0
The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 	0
A total of 359 @DISEASE$ cases were observed over a median follow-up period of 6.3 years.	0
@FOOD$ consumption was not associated with decreased risk for @DISEASE$ in the total population (p for trend = 0.0687).	0
In women under 50 years of age, however, @FOOD$ consumption was inversely associated with @DISEASE$ risk.	2
In the comparison between highest (≥1 serving/day) and lowest (<1 serving/week) intake categories of @FOOD$, the multivariate HR (95% CI) was 0.58 (0.35–0.97, p for trend = 0.0195)) among women under 50 years of age.	0
In conclusion, our findings show that @FOOD$ consumption in Korean women aged 50 or younger is associated with a decreased risk for @DISEASE$, when compared to those who never or rarely consumed @FOOD$.	2
Further studies need to be conducted to assess this relationship and confirm these results.	0
The role of specific food groups and diet variety on the risk of @DISEASE$ has been considered using data from a case‐control study conducted between 1992 and 1997 in the Swiss Canton of Vaud.	0
Cases were 156 patients (126 males, 30 females) aged under 75 (median age 56) years with incident, histologically confirmed @DISEASE$ of the oral cavity and pharynx, and controls were 284 subjects (246 males, 38 females, median age 57 years), admitted to the same university hospital for a wide spectrum of acute, non‐neoplastic conditions unrelated to tobacco and alcohol consumption or to long‐term modification of diet.	0
After allowance for education, alcohol, tobacco and total energy intake, significant trends of increasing risk with more frequent intake emerged for @FOOD$ (OR = 2.3 for the highest tertile), @FOOD$ (OR = 2.1) and @FOOD$ and @FOOD$ (OR = 3.2).	0
Inverse trends in risk were observed for @FOOD$ (OR = 0.4 for the highest tertile), @FOOD$ (OR = 0.5), @FOOD$ (OR = 0.3), @FOOD$ (OR = 0.1), @FOOD$ (OR = 0.4) and @FOOD$ (OR = 0.2).	0
The addition of a serving per day of @FOOD$ was associated with an about 50% reduction in @DISEASE$ risk.	2
The most favourable diet for @DISEASE$ risk is therefore given by infrequent consumption of @FOOD$ and, most of all, frequent @FOOD$ intake.	2
Diet diversity was inversely related to @DISEASE$: ORs were 0.35 for the highest tertile of total diversity, 0.24 for @FOOD$ and 0.34 for @FOOD$ diversity.	2
In terms of attributable risk, high @FOOD$ intake accounted for 49% of @DISEASE$ in this population, low vegetable intake for 65% and low fruit intake for 54%.	3
Besides @FOOD$, diet has been thought to be associated with @DISEASE$ risk.	1
We thus analyzed the role of various food groups, as well as specific @FOOD$, in a case‐control study conducted in Northern Italy and the Swiss Canton of Vaud from 1992 to 2000.	0
Our study included 527 incident, histologically confirmed cases and 1,297 frequency‐matched controls, selected among patients admitted to the same hospitals as cases for acute, nonneoplastic conditions, unrelated to smoking, alcohol consumption and long‐term modifications of diet.	0
The subjects' usual diet was investigated through a validated food frequency questionnaire, including 78 foods and beverages.	0
Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using unconditional multiple logistic regression models.	0
After adjustment for major confounding factors, a significant trend of increasing risk was observed for @FOOD$ (OR = 1.7 for the highest compared to the lowest quintile), @FOOD$ (OR = 3.1), @FOOD$ (OR = 1.7), @FOOD$ (OR = 1.6) and @FOOD$ (OR = 1.6).	0
Significant inverse associations were observed for @FOOD$ (OR = 0.7), @FOOD$ (OR = 0.2), @FOOD$ (OR = 0.3), @FOOD$ (OR = 0.6) and other @FOOD$ (OR = 0.5).	0
In regard to @FOOD$, a significant reduction of @DISEASE$ risk was observed for @FOOD$ (OR = 0.4) and specific @FOOD$ (OR = 0.6), while mixed seed oils were directly associated with laryngeal cancer risk (OR = 2.2).	2
Our study suggests that increasing @FOOD$, decreasing meat consumption and perhaps substituting @FOOD$ or specific @FOOD$ for other types of seasoning lipids might help reduce@DISEASE$ risk.	2
In regard to seasoning fats, a significant reduction of cancer risk was observed for olive oil (OR = 0.4) and specific seed oils (OR = 0.6), while @FOOD$ were directly associated with @DISEASE$ risk (OR = 2.2).	3
The incidence of @DISEASE$ overall in Mediterranean countries is lower than in Scandinavian countries, the United Kingdom, and the United States.	0
This is mostly accounted for by the lower incidence among Mediterranean countries of @DISEASE$ of the large bowel, breast, endometrium, and prostate.	0
These forms of @DISEASE$ have been linked to dietary factors, particularly low consumption of @FOOD$, and to a certain extent, high consumption of meat.	2
These forms of @DISEASE$ have been linked to dietary factors, particularly low consumption of vegetables and fruit, and to a certain extent, high consumption of @FOOD$.	3
The traditional Mediterranean diet is characterized by high consumption of @FOOD$, relatively low consumption of red meat, and high consumption of @FOOD$, which in several studies has been reported to be more beneficial against @DISEASE$ than other forms of added lipids.	2
By taking into account the established or presumed nutritional causation of major forms of @DISEASE$ and the composition of the traditional @FOOD$, estimates can be derived concerning the fraction of @DISEASE$ occurrence in highly developed Western countries that could be attributed to their diets in comparison with the healthy traditional Mediterranean diet.	1
Although estimates can only be crude, it can be calculated that up to 25% of the incidence of @DISEASE$, ∼15% of the incidence of @DISEASE$, and ∼10% of the incidence of @DISEASE$ could be prevented if the populations of highly developed Western countries could shift to the traditional @FOOD$.	2
@FOOD$ has been mentioned in the literature has a potentially important agent for preventing the development of @DISEASE$.	2
However, the currently available evidence on the subject is contradictory and inconclusive.	0
In this Cochrane systematic review, patients taking supplemental @FOOD$ on its various forms (@FOOD$), regardless the dose, duration and route of administration, were compared with placebo, healthy adults without any intervention or adults with a disease in a stable phase, non-related with @FOOD$ metabolism.	0
The results showed that currently, there is no firm evidence that @FOOD$ supplementation increases or decreases the risk of @DISEASE$ occurrence, mainly in elderly community-dwelling women.	1
Though at risk of type I errors due to small samples and substantial dropout of participants during the trials, the administration of supplemental @FOOD$ led to a 12% (CI 95%: 2 a 22%) decreased in @DISEASE$ mortality, while the administration of supplemental @FOOD$ decreased all-cause mortality by 7% (CI 95%: 2 a 12%).	2
The combined administration of supplements of @FOOD$ induced an increased incidence of nephrolithiasis.	0
The importance of @FOOD$ in bone and phosphocalcic status is well recognized by the scientific and medical communities; however, recently identified properties of this cholesterol derived molecule, such as immunomodulator and anti@DISEASE$ activities, are yet discussed.	2
Actually, the debate is not so much about the new @FOOD$ properties, but rather about the optimal concentration required to reach these properties.	0
The difficulty in determining the norms is rendered even more complex by the existence of a @FOOD$ receptor gene polymorphism.	0
The body pool of this @FOOD$ depends essentially on its endogenous synthesis, but also on its dietary intakes.	0
Many epidemiological studies interested in @FOOD$ serum level and @DISEASE$ suggest a relation between low @FOOD$ level and @DISEASE$ risk, especially in breast and colon adenocarcinomas.	2
In vitro, many studies showed, in different human and animal malignant cell lines, that this molecule exerts anti@DISEASE$ activities: it induces apoptosis and cell differentiation as well as it inhibits proliferation and angiogenesis.	0
This review tries to update the current knowledge on @FOOD$ and, more particularly, the potential interest of this molecule in @DISEASE$ prevention and management.	2
